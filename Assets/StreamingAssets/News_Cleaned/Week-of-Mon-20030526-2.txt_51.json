He said he had appeared on a local talk radio program recently to talk against A. 4884/S 2996. He said he thought that Kuhl would \"take his cue from the Assembly\" and would wait until the bill had been passed in the Assembly to unstar it in the Senate. He said he talked to Magee (chair of the Assembly Agriculture Committee) and that Magee said he intended to bring the bill for a vote in committee. He also said he thought people ought to write to Smith and ask him to withdraw the bill. I told him that I was mad at the NYCLU because they had not responded to my letter or my phone calls, asking them to come out against this bill. (Luster had been a lawyer for the ACLU years ago.)\n\nHere's what I'd like people to do:\n\n1. Write to Smith and ask him to withdraw the bill. Send a copy of your letter to Kuhl.\n\nAssemblyman Richard Smith\n619 LOB\nAlbany, NY 12248\nFax: 518-455-5560\n\nSenator Randy Kuhl\n310 LOB\nAlbany, NY 12247\nFax: 518-426-6976\n\n2. Send a letter to your assemblymember, opposing the bill, with a copy to Magee. If you're really into this, sending a copy of your letter to all members of the Assembly Ag. Committee would be even better. You can get their names and addresses by going to http://www.assembly.state.ny.us\n\nAssemblyman William Magee\n641 LOB\nAlbany, NY 12248\nFax: 518-455-5237\n\nRemember, committee chair only brings bills before their committees that they think will pass. It's rare that a bill doesn't pass out of committee. If Magee is planning to bring this bill before his committee, it's because he thinks it will pass.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to email me."
