    "contenido": "Builders for Medallion Homes construct a house in a Bexar County subdivision that's designed to blend with the natural habitat.\n\nBuilders spared the greenbelt area next to this home built by Medallion Homes. The house was designed to be compatible with the nearby woods.\n\n\"I liked the fact that they had gently placed a house so as not to disturb anything in the surrounding area,\" Green said.\n\nFinesilver Ranch is not a certified Urban Wildlife Program conservation development, Green said, but it could easily qualify.\n\nCertified urban wildlife yards either retain or put back native plants, mainly small fruit-bearing trees and shrubs such as persimmons and agaritas. Three criteria—shelter, food, and water—make the yard a certifiable habitat.\n\n\"It was intended for homeowners,\" Green said. \"But then other entities sought to get involved—businesses, school districts, and in this case a builder.\""
