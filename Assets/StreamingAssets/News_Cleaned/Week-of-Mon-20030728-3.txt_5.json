    "contenido": "Here's a tip that vegetarians and savvy menu planners have been sitting on for more than a decade. And it's a good one.\n\nWhat if you could indulge in all your favorite foods such as nachos, pizza, spaghetti sauce, burritos, deli sandwiches, bacon and chicken fingers, but with a fraction of the saturated fats, calories, and cholesterol usually associated with those foods?\n\nWhat would you say to a juicy, delicious burger with 12 grams of protein but less than 100 calories and one gram of fat? Impossible? Not if you replace animal-based meats with meat alternatives.\n\nIf the words \"meat alternative\" conjure images of bland, blobby tofu and side trips to the health food store, here's welcome news: your local supermarket has a full range of meat substitutes fashioned to replicate the taste and texture of bacon, pepperoni, ground round, and chicken strips— but without the heart-unhealthy cholesterol and fat.\n\nOne misconception (about veggie meats) regards taste, says Kurtis Hooley, managing director of Hain Celestial Canada, the parent company of Vancouver-based Yves Veggie Cuisine. Yves, which supplies McDonald's Canada with McVeggie burgers and hot dog stands with jumbo veggie dogs, is North America's leading supplier of packaged, soy-based mock meats.\n\n\"Meat alternatives have come a long way and many consumers remember tasting tofu years ago and believe soy-based meat alternatives will taste the same,\" Hooley adds. \"All tofu is soy but not all soy is tofu.\"\n\nAnimal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) recommends faux meats and its Golden Bun awards recognize the best in veggie burgers.\n\nPETA pegs annual sales of veggie burgers in the U.S. at about $300 million, which may be a drop in the bucket compared to the billion-dollar fast food industry. Yves pegs the meat alternative market in Canada at $33 million.\n\nNevertheless, many marquee chains, including Burger King, Harvey's, and McDonald's, now offer veggie burgers. Even mom-and-pop carnivore havens like Toronto's Apache Burger and Dangerous Dan's have the veggie option."
