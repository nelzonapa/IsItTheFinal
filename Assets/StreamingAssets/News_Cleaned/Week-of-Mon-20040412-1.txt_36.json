    "contenido": "It wasn't just that Edward Baker allegedly battered the cat in the face. Or that he chased it around the blood-spattered laundry room. Or that he extinguished cigarettes on another cat's paws. It was, authorities said, that he acted methodically, intentionally. That's why the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is putting national focus on the Macomb County case, said Daniel Paden, a cruelty caseworker with the animal rights organization. These malicious, deliberate acts — these acts don't bode well for the future, Paden said. Paden recently wrote Macomb County Prosecutor Carl Marlinga, urging him to \"vigorously prosecute\" Baker of Clinton Township by demanding jail time and psychiatric counseling. Paden said the Norfolk, Va., organization sees hundreds of cases a week in which people mistreat or kill animals. But the organization only writes about 10 letters a week demanding that prosecutors act."
