    "contenido": "DOLGEVILLE - Two more arrests were made Tuesday in connection with what looks like a graduation prank that went too far at Dolgeville High School.\n\nOn the early morning of June 15, a Dolgeville village police officer checked on the high school and found a number of dead animals about the grounds. A decaying deer carcass had been dumped in front of the school's main entrance and two freshly killed cats hung from the high school marquee and a \"Do Not Enter\" sign on the property. A second deer carcass hung from a school fence. Eggs had been thrown at the school and fish organs along with a dead frog were found on the marquee. There was vulgar language directed at a faculty member sprayed on the sidewalk.\n\nIt appears the act of vandalism was a graduation prank that got out of hand.\n\n...\n\nUnder 1999's \"Buster's Law,\" also known as the Felony Animal Cruelty Act, aggravated cruelty to domestic animals, such as killing two cats and hanging them on display, is a felony offense punishable by up to two years in prison and a $5,000 fine."
