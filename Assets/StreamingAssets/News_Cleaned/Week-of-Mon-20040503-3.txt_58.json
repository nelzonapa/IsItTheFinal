    "contenido": "Twenty-five years of commercial hunting across the South Australian savannah, Peter Absalom cannot recall a drought killing off kangaroos as it has in the past 12 months.\n\n\"Everybody is feeling the pain,\" Absalom says. \"In a drought, nothing survives... the poor things.\"\n\nAbsalom is a \"field processor\" who works around Mulyungarie Station, north of Broken Hill. He culls roos under the annual quota set down by National Parks and Wildlife after aerial surveys of the kangaroo population inside a \"commercial zone\".\n\nHis kills help service a regulated $200 million industry, which is a by-product of a government-mandated kangaroo cull in South Australia, Western Australia, NSW, and Queensland. For consumers, this is presented as a range of products including kangaroo fillets, steaks, a range of marinated steaks, kebabs, mini roasts, sausages, burgers, and mince.\n\nAbsalom's anecdotal account of the drought's impact is confirmed by Stuart Cairns, a University of New England zoologist and population ecologist, who has just returned from Mulyungarie and says the density in the area has fallen from more than 50 kangaroos per square kilometre to about 15 per square kilometre.\n\n\"It's knocked them for a six,\" Dr Cairns says of the drought's impact on the kangaroo population. \"In NSW, numbers are probably down by 50 percent. I do my work in South Australia and numbers are down there by a third and I think they will go down again.\""
