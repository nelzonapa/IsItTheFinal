    "contenido": "OREGON CITY — Sarah Christopherson charted the course that led to the high school diploma she will receive this summer.\n\nFifteen months ago, Christopherson became a vegetarian and later a vegan, eating no meat, eggs, cheese, or any food derived from animals.\n\nFor her, it was an act of conscience. She was repelled by factory farming where animals might be caged throughout their lives.\n\n\"I just didn’t like the process that (animals) went through,\" Christopherson said.\n\n\"I thought it was just a phase, but for her, she was choosing it as a way of life,\" Eunice Christopherson said."
