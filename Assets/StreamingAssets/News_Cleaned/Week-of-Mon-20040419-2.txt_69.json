    "contenido": "Many discriminating cat lovers know exactly which cat they want, are willing to pay for it and won’t settle for anything less,” reads the website for Genetic Savings and Clone, now charging pet owners $50, 000 to clone their cat.\n\nWhat the Savings and Clone calls “discriminating cat fanciers,” most Americans would call suckers or fools. (Another word a friend used was “creepy.”) Thousands of cats are killed every day in animal shelters for lack of a home. Yet some people with more money than sense are ready to spend more than the median U.S. household income in a vain attempt to sort of recreate their cat."
