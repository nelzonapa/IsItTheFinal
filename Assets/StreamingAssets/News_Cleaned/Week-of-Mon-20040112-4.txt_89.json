    "contenido": "Recently a deer tried to cross in front of my car just over the hill south of Irish Hills golf course. It didn’t make it.\n\nI only saw the flash of a deer head against the right front fender, then the sound as the animal hit the right side of my car. The right side mirror was damaged, there was a large dent in the right front door, and molding pulled loose and bent sheet metal around the right rear wheel opening. It didn’t look like that much damage, but the tab came to $2,448.\n\n...\n\nBefore the settlers ravaged what is now Ohio, the land was 85% forest, most of it densely covered, a forest that contained a wide variety of wildlife. The wildlife was a carefully balanced ecosystem that evolved over eons and kept the population of animals and game birds in check. Part of that system were cougar and lynx, which were very efficient predators at keeping the deer population in check.\n\n...\n\nAs I said, there are simply too many deer in the county. So what’s the next move, if any? Well, extending the hunting season and increasing the number of deer allowed each hunter would bring down the population. But would that bring the census down to a reasonable level?\n\nProbably not, in my opinion. Thinning out the herd would seem to be an alternative. But try getting that past the animal rights activists, or even the governor. Maybe we could get the Ohio Legislature involved to make it illegal for a deer to run into a car."
