Those that have signs of the disease will be sent to slaughter and the rest will be marked and set free, according to Karen Cooper, a spokeswoman for the Montana Department of Livestock. The bison, a mix of calves, yearlings, and adults, were hazed into a pen just before noon Tuesday near Horse Butte, west of Yellowstone. The bison were then loaded onto trailers and trucked to another holding pen to be tested for brucellosis. Some of the bison had been hazed back into the park on January 28, February 5, and February 13. These were some of the same animals. We could not get them back in the park so today it was a capture operation. Several agencies participated in the capture, including the Department of Livestock, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, National Park Service, and the U.S. Forest Service. Through a state and federal bison management plan, government agents haze and sometimes capture bison that leave Yellowstone. The plan is intended to reduce the risk that bison will transmit brucellosis to cattle in the area. Captured bison can be sent to slaughter without testing for the disease when the population exceeds 3,000, according to the plan. Park officials estimate there are currently more than 4,200 bison in the park."
