    "contenido": "Pulaski Police Officer Tim Wroda stated his intention to determine who placed three Australian Shepherd puppies, whose necks were tied with tight ropes, inside a plastic garbage bag and left them to die in a remote dumpster on the campus of Martin Methodist College. One of the puppies, a female, survived, while its two brothers perished from suffocation. A student discovered the bag and took the dogs to the Giles County Animal Hospital, where they were later taken by Donna Dixon, president of Adoptable Angels, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping abandoned animals."
