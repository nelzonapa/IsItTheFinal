    "contenido": "Professional fund-raisers apparently still love Indiana, despite a tough state do-not-call list that now includes nearly 60 percent of Indiana's residential phone lines.\n\nIndiana's no-call law covers business solicitations and calls from charities that use professional telemarketers, but exempts charities that use their own volunteers and/or employees.\n\nOne of the toughest do-not-call laws in the United States, the list administered by the Indiana attorney general went into effect Jan. 1, 2002.\n\nSince then, the attorney general's office has logged more than 6,000 complaints about violations of the law from consumers. It has reached voluntary compliance agreements with 139 companies accused of violating the rule. Of those, 124 also paid fines that, so far, total $351,000.\n\nProfessional fund-raisers also are required to register their Indiana telemarketing campaigns with the state. Two years ago, when Attorney General Steve Carter first published the list on his Web site, www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/consumer/charityfundraisers.htm, it contained 350 active campaigns.\n\nThe newest list, effective Jan. 1, contains 331 active campaigns — very nearly the same number. (See chart, Pages 8-9B)\n\n\"Right now, it just narrows down who they can call,\" said Summer Burgin, a spokeswoman for Carter's office.\n\nProfessional telemarketers still have a million Hoosier residential lines they legitimately can call, as well as business phone numbers, which are not part of the no-call program.\n\nAnd those calls can be quite lucrative for the telemarketing firms. Fifty of the current Indiana campaigns guarantee just 1 percent to the charity, with the professional fund-raiser claiming the remainder.\n\nThat's actually better than the 2002 list, on which 100 campaigns promised just 1 percent to the charity.\n\nAlthough state law says the donations split should represent a good faith estimate of the final breakdown, \"some choose to go to the end of the spectrum,\" Burgin said. That's because some professional fund-raisers who register campaigns with the state don't want to be held to a higher number should costs exceed their expectations.\n\nOne current campaign, conducted by professional telemarketer Telefund Inc. on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights organization, lists a negative 8 percent share to the nonprofit.\n\nIn other words, Telefund keeps 100 percent of what it raises and PETA pays them an additional 8 percent on top of that."
