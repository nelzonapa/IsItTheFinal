    "contenido": "Colorado Animal Rescue (CARE) rescued 30 cats from a house in Parachute on Feb. 5, after their owner died. CARE received a call from the Parachute Police Department asking for help in rescuing \"a lot\" of cats from the home of a man who had died, said CARE executive director Leslie Rockey. Parachute police found the cats when they discovered the man's body, said Rockey.\n\n\"We filled the cars,\" Rockey said, and told police, \"Meet us there at 6.\" When Rockey and Heather Martin, a kennel assistant, opened the front door of the house, the cats swarmed around them.\n\n\"As soon as we walked in they were all there, meowing and crying at us,\" she said. \"It was a mess,\" said Rockey. \"It was a very poor living environment.\"\n\nAll the cats were sick, some pregnant, and living in their own feces, said Rockey. Rockey and Martin immediately started plucking cats from the floor and putting them into the kennels they had brought with them from the Spring Valley shelter.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" said Martin. \"It was like picking apples,\" she said of putting the cats in the kennels."
