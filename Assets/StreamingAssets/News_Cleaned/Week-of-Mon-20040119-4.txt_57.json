    "contenido": "There's nothing better than coming home in the afternoons for Mary Marshall Van Sant.\n\nI pull in the driveway, and my dogs are so glad to see me they're doing a body wag,\" she said.\n\nVan Sant, who has been a pet owner all of her life, has three dogs and one cat on her Colbert County property. If a complaint is issued about barking or smell, however, Van Sant could be forced to give one of those animals up to be in compliance with an ordinance that prohibits more than three dogs and/or cats on the premises.\n\nSheffield and Tuscumbia already have this ordinance on the books, and Muscle Shoals will vote on adopting it at the Feb. 2 council meeting.\n\nCouncilman Allen Noles said adopting the ordinance \"will put us in line with the other municipalities, so animal control can enforce the same (law). It will make it easier for them.\"\n\nColbert County Animal Control Director Tommy Morson says the ordinance has proved helpful in dealing with cases of hoarding, when individuals may have 20 to 50 animals in their care.\n\nIn 2003, animal control received two reported cases of hoarding."
