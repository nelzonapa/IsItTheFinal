    "contenido": "A non-human molecule found in red meat and milk enters the human system when consumed — and accumulates particularly in tumors, according to a study by U.S. researchers.\n\nThe compound, known as sialic acid, is present on the surfaces of animal cells but absent in humans. This suggests that animals have a version called Neu5Gc, whereas humans carry Neu5Ac.\n\nHowever, scientists at the University of California, San Diego discovered that this molecule does appear in the human body and can be absorbed through red meat and milk consumption.\n\nAdditionally, they observed that the body generates an immune response against this substance.\n\nDr. Ajit Varki and his team report these findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (news - web sites). They caution that recommendations cannot yet be made based on their research."
