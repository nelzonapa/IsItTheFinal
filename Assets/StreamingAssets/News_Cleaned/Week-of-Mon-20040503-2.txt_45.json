The now happy-looking puppy is anywhere from three to five months old, but for most of its life it has been wearing a collar much too small, leaving a deep gouge around its neck. \"The sad fact is his skin grew around the collar which created a great deal of infection, loss of blood supply, and some pretty significant secondary complications,\" said Stacy O'Quinn, a veterinarian with the Riverwalk Animal Hospital.\n\nO'Quinn took the puppy in Wednesday, when Jasper County Animal Control first found it. She says it's not the worst case of animal abuse she's seen, but this puppy's hurt pretty bad.\n\nToday, veterinarians are going to take the dog into surgery. They're going to have to cut off clumps of dead skin and basically sew its neck back together.\n\n\"This is a situation where someone put a collar on a dog that was young and they either neglected or forgot they had a dog or the dog got loose and was not approached for some time, and obviously dogs can grow and collars can't grow,\" said O'Quinn."
