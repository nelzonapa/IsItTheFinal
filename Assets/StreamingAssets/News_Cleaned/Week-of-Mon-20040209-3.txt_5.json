    "contenido": "For thousands of years, the majestic North American buffalo roamed freely over the wide-open plains of the Canadian Prairies. Today, most of these brown, woolly beasts spend their time grazing on ranches - or in the case of Bailey, watching TV in the living room of an Alberta family's home.\n\nJim and Linda Sautner are the proud owners of Bailey, a nearly 4-year-old bison, who has a penchant for spending his time inside the couple's home, about 20 km west of the provincial capital of Edmonton.\n\n\"My wife wouldn't let me bring my German Shepherd puppy in the house one day, so I got even with her by bringing Bailey in,\" Jim Sautner said. \"He's made a mess on the carpet a couple of times, so now we bring out an ice cream pail whenever he gives us that look.\"\n\nThe Sautners, who own 270 heads of buffalo, have become accustomed to having the 725 kg beast in their living room staring at the television. He prefers to watch *The Nature of Things*, according to Jim, referring to a Canadian nature television series.\n\nThe couple rescued Bailey as a baby, after the calf was abandoned by its mother. Along with farm hands, they bottle-fed Bailey with milk on a daily basis and the affinity for one another grew rapidly."
