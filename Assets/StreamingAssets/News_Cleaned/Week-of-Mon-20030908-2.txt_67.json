    "contenido": "Local farmers mixed on milk plan\n\nA controversial farmer-initiated program designed to cut milk production nationwide and raise the milk price paid to farmers has drawn mixed reviews from Clark County dairy owners.\n\nSome local farmers and milk processors worry the supply reduction, set to begin this fall, could also drive milk prices up at the grocery store and alienate consumers. Others are skeptical whether the plan, conceived by the 60,000-member National Milk Producers Federation, will work.\n\n\"It's sorta idiotic, isn't it?\" said Ron Andersen, the county's biggest dairyman, who runs about 1,200 cows and operates milk-processing and plastics plants and a truck line in Battle Ground. \"My history has made me negative to all this. I don't want anything to do with it. I work on the open market on the law of supply and demand.\"\n\nAny worry about retail milk prices rising seems to be misplaced. At Vancouver stores, milk sells for $2 to $5 a gallon, depending on packaging and brand. Store owners often price milk as a \"loss leader,\" selling it for little or no profit because it brings customers into the store where they buy other products."
