    "contenido": "Workers are putting bridge supports in place as they extend Dove Road from Dove Loop Road to North Main Street in Grapevine.\n\nGRAPEVINE - The gruff cacophony of construction equipment at Dove Road in Grapevine soon heralded other unfamiliar noises for Grapevine resident Lyn Murphy. Growls. Snarls. Howls.\n\n\"I heard this clang, clang, clang and rushed outside,\" said Murphy, who lives about a block away from a portion of the $6.2 million Dove Road expansion project. \"There were these baby raccoons washing their faces in the pool, and their mama was making all the noise trying to get into my barbecue.\"\n\nSince the road construction began along the undeveloped land, raccoons are not the only visitors, she said. Murphy and some neighbors have seen an increase in other nocturnal callers, such as foxes and coyotes.\n\nAnd she blames the road construction.\n\nDove Road is being extended from Dove Loop Road to North Main Street. The much-needed east-west main road will run through what is now a heavily wooded area, including almost 4 acres controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers, city officials said. The 16-month project is scheduled for completion by late 2004.\n\nMurphy has not taken her concerns to city officials yet, but they probably would not be surprised. City engineers went to considerable effort to ensure that as little of the natural area is affected as possible, but some animals are going to be displaced with any construction project, city officials said."
