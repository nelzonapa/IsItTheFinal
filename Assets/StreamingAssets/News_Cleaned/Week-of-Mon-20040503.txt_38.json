    "contenido": "[Animal concerns - more jobs added!!]\n\nA quart of whiskey, a pack of cigarettes, and a cube of LSD is better for you than eating one piece of meat, a doctor once told Peter Burwash, former Hawaii resident and Davis Cup champion turned tennis coach, author and motivational speaker.\n\n\"The trauma of the extra (meat-derived) chemicals in the body is horrendous,\" Burwash said, clarifying the analogy. \"An athlete should have no meat, fish, poultry or eggs.\"\n\nA professional tennis player for seven years, motivational speaker for 30 years, and vegetarian for 34 years, Burwash spoke about nutrition and exercise to nearly 150 attendees last Wednesday in the Kuykendall Auditorium.\n\nBurwash spends 150 days a year touring the world as a motivational speaker and has written 10 books on topics ranging from nutrition to leadership to teen suicide. The lecture was sponsored by the Vegetarian Society of Hawaii.\n\n...\nBurwash said Atkins was the \"epitome of poor health.\"\n\nThe Atkins diet also requires a significant protein intake. But too much protein can be detrimental, Burwash said, because it makes the blood acidic, drains bones of calcium, and causes tendons and ligaments to tear easily."
