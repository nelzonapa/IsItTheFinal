    "contenido": "The UCSD Guardian\n\nAs part of the annual World Week for Animals in Laboratories campaign, activists from UCSD Students Against Animal Suffering and San Diego Animal Advocates protested on April 20 against animal testing conducted at UCSD. Protesters stood at the intersection of La Jolla Village Drive and Villa La Jolla Drive, passing out information and holding signs with messages such as \"Unseen Cruelty, Suffering and Death?\" and \"Vivisection: Science Gone Mad?\"\n\n\"We learned of the cruel and wasteful experiments going on at UCSD and decided to have a protest in conjunction with World Week for Animals in Laboratories,\" Jill Fritz, president of San Diego Animal Advocates, said.\n\nDue to pressure from protesters, the UCSD School of Medicine decided in August 2003 to drop a course requirement in which students watched experiments and demonstrations on live dogs.\n\nAccording to Fritz, however, approximately 467 animal experiments are currently taking place at UCSD.\n\nThe protesters said the school still uses primates, rodents, and other animals to conduct research."
