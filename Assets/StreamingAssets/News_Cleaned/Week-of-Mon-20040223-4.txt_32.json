    "contenido": "With La Fiesta de los Vaqueros in town, opposing views on the treatment of rodeo animals are back on the front burner. The Animal Defense League of Arizona (ADLAZ) and two other animal-activist groups are planning to hold a protest Sunday outside of the Tucson Rodeo Grounds. Group leaders believe rodeo invokes naturally docile farm animals into violent behavior through acts of animal cruelty. Those working for and on the Tucson Rodeo Committee say rodeo livestock is too valuable to be treated poorly. Gary Williams, who has been general manager of La Fiesta since 1995, says animal activist groups do not base their opinions on fact. \"Animals are these people's livelihood,\" Williams said of those involved in rodeo. \"These animals aren't pets. They can withstand things other animals cannot.\" We are going out to protest the inherit animal abuse at the rodeo, said Gary Vella, chairman of the ADLAZ. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has long been against rodeo. PETA, the largest animal-rights organization in the world, contends rodeo animals are treated cruelly and sent to slaughter once the event ends. One intolerable action is using flank straps, which go around an animal's abdomen and groin, a PETA official said. The straps can cause them to suffer internal bleeding, she added. They also cause sores or other injuries. The Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association states in its animal welfare pamphlet that the flank strap does not induce animals to buck, but instead augments the bucking action, encouraging a bucking bronc or bull to kick high with its back feet."
