No confirmed sighting has ever been made\n\nMay 17, 2004\n\nThis could be a librarian's nightmare: Dig up enough data for a comprehensive report on Hector's beaked whale.\n\nA specimen of Hector's beaked whale was found dead on a western Australia beach on May 3. A photo showing what was left of the carcass was sent everywhere by the world's news services, piquing interest but supplying little data.\n\nA search in marine mammal archives, such as the Audubon Society Guide to Marine Mammals of the World, yielded the following:\n\nRecognition at sea: unknown. Behavior: unknown. Longevity: unknown. Estimated population: unknown. Influence of man: unknown. Habitat: prefers cool, temperate waters. Food and feeding: stomach analysis shows squid is the main food.\n\n\"Beaked whales really are an enigma,\" said whale biologist Phil Clapham, at the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service facility at Woods Hole, Mass.\n\nThey might be called rare, \"but there's a difference between calling something rare because you know it's rare, or calling it rare because of its cryptic behavior. They are deep divers, and don't spend much time on the surface.\"\n\nHeadlines"
