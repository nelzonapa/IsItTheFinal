    "contenido": "A public hearing has been scheduled on a proposed city animal-control law, but the plan is already drawing criticism, particularly for its three-dog limit per owner and its required registry of pit bull terriers. The public can have a say on the proposal at 7:30 p.m. Jan. 27 at City Hall, 420 Broadway.\n\nObjections to the law have surfaced already: About two dozen people, most of whom were opposed to the ordinance, attended a recent Common Council committee session and asked Rhinebeck resident Mahlon Goer, a member of the American Dog Owner Association, to speak for them.\n\nGoer described the ordinance as \"poorly written\" and \"poorly conceived.\" She said state laws prohibit municipalities from singling out specific breeds for legislative action.\n\n\"A breed-specific law punishes law-abiding citizens and their good dogs and does nothing to address those people who don’t license their dogs, don’t leash their dogs, or control their dogs,\" Goer said. \"That is the basic objection to any law that singles out a breed.\""
