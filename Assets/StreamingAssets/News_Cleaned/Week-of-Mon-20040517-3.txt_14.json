    "contenido": "The government today launched its plans for a new center to research alternatives to animal research. The science minister, Lord Sainsbury, claimed that the new center would help eliminate any unnecessary experiments on animals and the move was immediately welcomed by the science community. However, animal rights campaigners immediately condemned the move as a \"fig leaf\" to hide the real issue that experimentation involving animals was harmful and of little benefit. The center will work on the principal of the three Rs – replacement, reduction and refinement. The Office for Science and Technology has doubled its funding for alternatives to animal research from £330,000 to £660,000."
