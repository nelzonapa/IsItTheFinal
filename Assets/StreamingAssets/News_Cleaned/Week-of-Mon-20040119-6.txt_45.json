    "contenido": "With over 30,000 fast food restaurants in 121 countries globally, the company that acquired the hamburger franchise from two California brothers named Dick and Mac McDonald is more than just a restaurant chain.\n\nFor many, it represents something more: a symbol of American influence and power, of American hubris, of the dominance and crudeness of American culture, of the evils of globalization.\n\nYes, there are those who despise McDonald's—more for its concept than its food itself. The real issue isn't the taste; it's the idea behind the global fast-food empire.\n\nMcDonald's restaurants have faced protests and arson attacks in various parts of the world, including France where they're often targeted by animal rights activists. In the United States, anti-globalization protesters have also set fires at some of their locations.\n\nThis kind of negativity, however, makes Joan Kroc's charitable donations to organizations like the Salvation Army and NPR even sweeter. Her legacy, which includes leaving $1.5 billion to the Salvation Army, is particularly heartwarming given her husband's business acumen and philanthropic spirit."
