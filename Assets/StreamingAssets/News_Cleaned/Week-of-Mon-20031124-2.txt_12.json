    "contenido": "Thanksgiving! It means so many things. Turkey, giving thanks, turkey,\nfootball, more turkey, time spent with family eating turkey, reflecting on the\nblessings in our lives and of course Maalox moments from all the turkey.\n\nThis most American holiday has so many wonderful traditions, yet many people\nhave genuine difficulties during this day. Many of the traditions of\nThanksgiving surely must be disturbing to certain Liberals.\n\nSurely this day must cause great offenses to those afflicted with perpetual offendeditis. So before we partake in our feasts let us take a somewhat sarcastic look at what Thanksgiving might mean to some way out Leftists.\n\nFirst off, naturally, must be the animal rights types who surely suffer great consternation during Thanksgiving. I mean come on! Thanksgiving is much to do with people, whom animal rights types loath, eating animals, which these same animal rights types love.\n\nNow of course no one with any decency supports cruelty to animals but in the real world the most important jobs turkeys have is to be on the table in time for Thanksgiving. To most people this makes perfect sense. But to a PETA member this is blasphemous!\n\nSo every Thanksgiving animal rights types weep and gnash their teeth and curse all of us who eat these birds. While the rest of America is trying to justify that third piece of pecan pie while trying to stay awake for the Cowboys game, the PETA members are munching carrot sticks and crying for their departed turkey brothers. Now is this any way to enjoy a holiday?\n\nThen of course there are the radical feminists who must also surely despise this holiday. Think about your typical stone-faced, perpetually angry radical feminist and what they must surely suffer on this day."
