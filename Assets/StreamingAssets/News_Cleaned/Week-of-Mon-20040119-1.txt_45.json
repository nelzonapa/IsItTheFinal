    "contenido": "The Knoxville Zoo's two new tigers are something special.\n\nKali, a 6-year-old tiger bought from the Nashville Zoo, stands out due to her white coat. She is the zoo's second white tiger. The park's other white tiger, Ravi, is 16 years old.\n\nThe zoo's other new tiger has a common orange coat. However, Tevy, a 3-year-old Indochinese tiger, is one of only 37 of her species in U.S. zoos. Currently, visitors can see Kali in an exhibit near the park's wild dogs and cheetah habitats. Kali and her white older relative will not be exhibited together. They will alternate time on exhibit starting this spring after Ravi's habitat is expanded.\n\nTevy lives in her own exhibit, near the zoo's gibbons. She arrived from Chaffee Zoo in Fresno, California, as part of a loan."
