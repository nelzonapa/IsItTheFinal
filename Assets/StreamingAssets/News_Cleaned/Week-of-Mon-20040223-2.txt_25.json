    "contenido": "On Wednesday, animal-rights activists who have targeted the company filed a lawsuit against them, requesting a judge to order a halt to actions that have escalated from harassment and intimidation to full-blown terrorism. The lawsuit claims that after months of making threatening phone calls and visits to employees' homes, vandalizing employees' private property, and so forth, Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA (SHAC USA) had a hand in last August's bombing of Chiron's headquarters.\n\n\"On information and belief, Chiron alleges that the FBI has linked the person suspected of carrying out the bombings, a man named Daniel Andres [sic -- San Diego], to SHAC USA's president, Kevin Jonas,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nFBI Special Agent LaRae Quy would not comment further but noted, \"We only have charges pending against Mr. San Diego and not against anyone else,\" though they believe he has received support.\n\nIn October, Daniel Andreas San Diego, 26, of Sonoma, was named as a suspect in both the Chiron bombing and the September bombing of Shaklee Corp. in Pleasanton. No injuries were reported in either explosion. San Diego remains a fugitive, considered armed and dangerous, with a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.\n\nSHAC USA spokeswoman Alex Bailey characterized Chiron's complaint as a \"SLAPP suit,\" a strategic lawsuit against public participation aimed at limiting SHAC's First Amendment rights.\n\n\"If the Chiron suit looks anything like the other 12 SLAPP suits we've come across, it's an entire lawsuit based on a guilt-by-association theory that doesn't square with the Constitution,\" she said. \"Never once has there been any judgment against us, and we don't expect there to be one in this case.\""
