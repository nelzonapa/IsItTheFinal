    "contenido": "Five Alaskans have been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of illegally killing black bears for their gallbladders and other parts, which are highly valued in Asian markets. The five suspects, all from Anchorage, were involved in two separate conspiracies that led to the capture of at least 14 black bears in 2002 and 2003. Federal and state law enforcement agencies are also investigating other poaching cases involving up to 50 black bears across the state. The specific details of these additional investigations remain undisclosed."
