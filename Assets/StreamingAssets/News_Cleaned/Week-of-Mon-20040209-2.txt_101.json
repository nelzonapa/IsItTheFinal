    "contenido": "A man scheduled to appear in court Friday on felony animal abuse charges continued to collect dozens of cats, rabbits, and dogs in his Snow Creek area home despite a restraining order to stay away from animals. A visit to a house where Doug Yates and his wife, Joyce, were being evicted revealed that they had kept more than a dozen cats and rabbits shut into an otherwise empty bedroom, some in cages. Neighbors estimated there were over 30 animals in the home. Animal activists have recently expressed concern about what they call animal collectors. In the past two years, several widely reported cases of animal cruelty, including problems at facilities operated by the Riverside County Animal Control Services, have brought efforts for reform. At the Yates home on Wednesday, the metal blinds on a front window were clawed to shreds in places and through a window streaks of feces were visible on the walls and marble floors. Joyce Yates, who is not charged with any crime, said in a telephone interview that she had taken in the animals to save them from being destroyed in local shelters."
