    "contenido": "Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry on Sunday proposed several changes to the system of monitoring livestock in response to the discovery of mad cow disease in the United States. Kerry's plan calls for a national tracking system, a sharp increase in the testing of cattle for the disease, and an unspecified level of financial aid to farmers who stand to suffer as a result of the discovery.\n\nHoward Dean, also campaigning in Iowa, called on the Department of Agriculture to implement immediately a number of measures to restore confidence in the U.S. beef industry. Since the announcement that a now-slaughtered Holstein cow from Washington state was sick with mad cow disease, more than two dozen countries have halted imports of U.S. beef, valued at $3.4 billion a year.\n\nThe current mad cow investigation underscores the urgent need for a national system to make diseased livestock easier to track and contain, according to Kerry, a Massachusetts senator. Downed animals, those too sick or injured to stand or walk unassisted, should not be processed until the results of their tests are known."
