    "contenido": "It was one of the largest fires I've ever seen,\" Mobley said this week, recalling the destruction that raged on the mountain around him five years ago today. \"It looked like something exploded. You could tell there was no way to stop it.\"\n\nThe fire launched an investigation that pulled in Boulder environmentalists. It didn't occur to Mobley during the 14 hours he worked on the mountaintop that the blaze was set by arsonists, he said.\n\nTwo days later, an anonymous message sent to news media outlets said the fires were the work of the little-known Earth Liberation Front—an attack on a \"greedy corporation\" on behalf of the environment.\n\nFor the shadowy ELF, known mainly by detectives investigating much smaller attacks, most in the Northwest, the blaze was a coming-out party.\n\nThe group's emergence as the standard-bearer for the radical environmental fringe continues to raise questions of whether the willingness to resort to destruction aids the cause or threatens the environmental movement's existence.\n\nFBI questions and the grand jury probe continued for more than a year. No tie to the Vail fires or ELF ever emerged involving Doon, Ancient Forest Rescue members or anyone else, that was strong enough to compel an indictment.\n\nDoon calls the grand jury investigation a sort of \"un-American McCarthyism\" and said the apparent fixation on Ancient Forest Rescue probably hurt the investigation more than it helped.\n\nInvestigators and environmental critics such as Arnold tend to overstate the power and presence of ELF, he said.\n\nRod Coronado disagrees. The 37-year-old Tucson resident is the unofficial spokesman for ELF and one of the most high-profile figures from the radical animal-rights and environmental world. Coronado was in federal prison at the time of the Vail fires, serving four years after pleading guilty to helping a 1992 firebombing of a Michigan State University animal laboratory, one of a string of attacks on university research labs."
