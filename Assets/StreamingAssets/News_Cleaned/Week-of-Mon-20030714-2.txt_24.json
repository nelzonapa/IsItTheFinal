    "contenido": "There are many consequences to the massive scale of our food production, distribution, marketing, and consumption. While we may celebrate its convenience or laud the freedom of choice it seems to provide, in reality, its convenience masks disturbing inefficiencies, unsustainable extractive practices, and terrible injustices in distribution. The apparent abundance masks a basic orthodoxy in the way our food is grown, processed, and marketed. Freedom of choice really is not what it seems; since in fact, we obtain most of our food within a narrowly defined system of capitalist production, underwritten by government subsidies at all levels—from the point of production (price controls, fallow payments, environmental cleanup of toxins, wars to protect fuel inputs, and laws that favor large-scale farms at the expense of family farms and smallholding) to the point of consumption (food stamps, laws that favor corporate supermarkets).\n\nWe have many choices within one basic food system, rather than many choices within a heterogeneous food system.\n\nVegans may wince, but cane sugar is responsible for far more animal deaths even at the level of species extinction than honey will ever be. Fruit and vegetable sugars, if obtainable locally, can be as responsible as honey.\n\n--\n\n--"
