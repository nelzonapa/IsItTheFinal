Gary Hanson, the mall’s general manager, announced last fall that the mall wanted to move Howard, but didn’t think he would survive the trip due to his frail health.\n\nSince then, the mall’s only surviving dolphin has had a specific diet and exercise regimen to get his strength up, although the effects have been minimal. “He’s not gaining enough weight,” Hanson said this week, adding that Howard’s health has not been deteriorating.\n\nA new home for Howard, should he be moved, hasn’t been picked yet. Brian Joseph, a marine veterinarian from Redding, California, has been seeing Howard once a month since August. He said Thursday that Howard is improving bit by bit, and eating more than he has in five to ten years, but is still not close to being able to survive a move out of the mall. “I expected this to be a gradual process and it’s turning out to be one.”\n\nJoseph said Howard may never be healthy enough to move. “I look at his progress with guarded optimism.” Animal rights groups are growing impatient, believing that West Edmonton Mall is dragging its feet on moving Howard to another location. Animal rights activists don’t believe the dolphin’s health will improve until he is moved."
