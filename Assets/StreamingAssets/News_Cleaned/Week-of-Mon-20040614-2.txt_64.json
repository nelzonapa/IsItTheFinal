A state agency chose Friday to let the animals stay on Morgan Island for at least two years because they produce income for South Carolina and are important to biomedical research nationally. The fate of the furry primates has been clouded since the S.C. Department of Natural Resources bought Morgan Island in 2002 for $20.5 million. Agency officials had to decide whether they should round up the monkeys so the animals wouldn't damage the nearly pristine environment of Morgan Island. Rhesus monkeys are native to Asia, but they have been kept and bred on the 400-acre island for use in medical experiments since 1979. The island, like others near Beaufort, is filled with live oak trees and palmettos and is bordered by salt marsh. Song birds and increasingly rare shorebirds, such as the oyster catcher, are found in the area. But the DNR hasn't seen any evidence that monkeys are wrecking maritime forests that attract birds to Morgan Island, according to an agency management plan. And DNR Director John Frampton said the federal medical research program depended heavily on Morgan Island as a supplier of monkeys. The island is the country's only free-range breeding colony for rhesus monkeys, the agency says.?This is one of the best populations of monkeys anywhere for medical purposes,? Frampton said.?I have difficulty... recommending those monkeys be taken off when there's no other place to put them.??"
