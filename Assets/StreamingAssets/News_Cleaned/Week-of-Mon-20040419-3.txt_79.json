    "contenido": "ROWS OF GENETICALLY ALtered tobacco plants fill a Hayward greenhouse, but they're not intended for cigarettes or cigars. Instead, they carry human antibodies that may one day help ward off tooth decay and the common cold. The plants are being developed by Planet Biotechnology of Hayward, one of a new breed of biotech companies that are taking a green approach to developing new drugs. If successful, they could lead to faster and less costly production of antibodies and proteins to treat anything from tooth decay to cancer, and give what many consider a deadly weed a new role in helping save lives. A major benefit of using plants is that they radically reduce the cost of production of drugs. They also eliminate the need to use transgenic animals, a process that animal rights groups have protested."
