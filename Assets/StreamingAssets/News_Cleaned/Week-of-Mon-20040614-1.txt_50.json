    "contenido": "The Cole Bros. Circus is coming to Dodd Stadium this weekend. Lyndsay Meiklem of Norwich is not going.\n\nMeiklem objects to the circus' use of animals in its performances.\n\n\"In the year 2004, it's an extremely antiquated form of entertainment,\" she said. \"I think it's a really cruel form of entertainment.\"\n\nMeiklem, 29, is organizing a protest outside the event and will distribute fliers with information about the issue.\n\nShe said circus animals live in artificial conditions and are forced to suppress their natural instincts through abusive training tactics.\n\n\"How we treat animals is a very important issue,\" she said. \"How we treat them is a direct reflection of our own society.\""
