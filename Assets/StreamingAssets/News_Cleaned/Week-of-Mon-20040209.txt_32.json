    "contenido": "Dressed in prisoner suits and dog and cat masks, activists in three Dutch cities will cram themselves into cages to illustrate the misery of animals neglected and killed in crude nutrition tests conducted by the Procter & Gamble (P&G)-owned pet-food company Iams, which also manufactures Eukanuba. Concerned PETA Europe members and dog- and cat-food purchasers will also hold signs reading, Stop Iams Cruelty. The protests will mark the official Dutch launch of PETA's international campaign against Iams - similar actions are taking place throughout Europe and North America."
