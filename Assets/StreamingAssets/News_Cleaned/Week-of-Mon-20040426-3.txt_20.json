    "contenido": "PHOENIX — Environmental groups that illegally interfere with everything from animal research to logging would be subject to the same criminal laws and financial sanctions as members of the Mafia and the Taliban under the terms of legislation given preliminary approval Thursday by the House of Representatives.\n\nOn a voice vote, lawmakers agreed to redefine the definition of criminal racketeering to include ecological or animal terrorism. This new law allows the government to go after the assets of both those who commit certain crimes and the organizations that support them.\n\n...\n\n\"If you spray-paint a building and it costs $250 or more (to repair), you could be labeled an animal or ecological terrorist,\" she said. \"It belittles the term 'terrorism.'\""
