    "contenido": "The independent inquiry found that Hall had seriously deviated from commonly accepted scientific practices. A similar finding was made in allegation three that the committee considered, yet no mention was made of this by the vice-chancellor.\n\nNor does he mention allegation five, which actually emerged during the course of the inquiry. While the inquiry made no adverse finding, the members uncovered damaging information—major problems with the way Hall changed his interpretation of data to suit different circumstances. This occurred in a paper and an abstract and concerns the definition of rejection. In one situation, defending the findings of an abstract to a conference, Hall interprets the results from a group of rats as rejection, but in another situation, a paper submitted for publication, he interprets the same data from the same rats as tolerance, not rejection.\n\nIn relation to the other allegations concerning missing data and the alleged misrepresentation of data and statistics in a grant application to the NHMRC, the Brennan inquiry found Hall had committed a significant falsehood, acted with reckless disregard for the truth, or with intent to deceive. Hume partially disagreed with the inquiry, relying on reasons which were very similar to the explanations given by Hall to the inquiry."
