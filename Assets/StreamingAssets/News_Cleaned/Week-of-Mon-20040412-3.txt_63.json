    "contenido": "Pets are being used as tools to keep members in line.\n\nThere is a growing body of evidence linking animal abuse and family violence, and those who take care of the victims of both say they believe that learning more about that connection will prompt more people to take notice and take action.\n\nThe Coastal Women's Shelter and the Colonial Capital Humane Society have aligned themselves with a national initiative, \"Animal Cruelty Is Family Violence,\" launched by the Humane Society of the United States to raise awareness of the connection during 2004 Animal Cruelty/Human Violence Awareness Week, which begins today."
