    "contenido": "A 25-year-old man named Arturo \"Art\" Federico has been charged with first-degree animal cruelty, which is considered a felony, for killing his girlfriend's 6-week-old kitten while under the influence of alcohol. Prosecutors stated that this incident occurred due to a drunken rage. \n\nOn Wednesday, Federico was additionally charged with fourth-degree assault, which is classified as a misdemeanor. According to the prosecutor's office, he allegedly pushed his 20-year-old girlfriend around, choked her, and then locked her out of their shared apartment.\n\nThe arrest took place approximately three hours after the incident when police were called to the scene. A K-9 officer and a police dog named Bosco were deployed to track down Federico. He was apprehended in a cemetery near the apartment building where he had fled. During the arrest, Bosco bit Federico's head, necessitating medical attention at Overlake Hospital Medical Center.\n\nFederico's girlfriend reported that he started drinking around 10 p.m. Saturday night. She observed him holding the kitten in both hands and throwing it onto the bed with considerable force. Later, he picked up the cat again and threw it down once more. When confronted by her, he reportedly yelled that the kitten had scratched his eye. Twenty minutes later, Federico began pushing and choking her before locking her out of the apartment.\n\nAfter regaining access to the apartment, she found her kitten, Mr. Sampson, deceased. Federico admitted to threatening to kill the kitten earlier but claimed that the cat had injured itself accidentally or jumped into an oven."
