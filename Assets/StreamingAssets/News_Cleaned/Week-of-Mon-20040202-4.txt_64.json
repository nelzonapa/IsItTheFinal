    "contenido": "AMES, Iowa – The temperature has dropped to 4 below, and the vast campus of Iowa State University is a snowy, sullen ghost town. Professors and students alike are away on winter break. It is not a promising time or place to drum up votes.\n\nRep. Dennis Kucinich doesn’t seem to notice, or care. Arriving late, a two-aide entourage in support, the little-known Democrat from Ohio starts firing off the moment he hits the overheated basement meeting room of the Collegiate United Methodist Church.\n\n“This campaign has picked up a lot of momentum!” he declares enthusiastically to the crowd of about 85.\n\nKucinich then lists the particulars of what he calls his “holistic world view.” If he were president, he says, he would replace US troops in Iraq with UN troops, within 90 days of taking office, and pay reparations to Iraqi families.\n\nHe would cut the Defense Department’s budget by 15 percent and establish a Department of Peace. He would repeal the North American Free Trade Agreement and withdraw the United States from the World Trade Organization.\n\n...\n\nYet, among those who gather to hear him, Kucinich inspires enormous enthusiasm. He attracts the true believers who were devoted to Green Party candidate Ralph Nader in 2000, but are looking for an alternative within the Democratic Party.\n\nIn Kucinich, a vehement opponent of the war in Iraq, a critic of the mainstream media, and a fervent advocate of free education, single-payer health care, workers’ rights, environmental protections, and legalized marijuana, they have him. The man is even a vegan.\n\n...\n\nHe worked as a TV reporter, a radio talk show host, and a lecturer. In 1982, his income totaled $38. Along the way, two marriages failed. He became a vegan, eating a diet free of animal products."
