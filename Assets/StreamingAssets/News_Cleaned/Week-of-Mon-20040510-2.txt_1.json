    "contenido": "City and country battled Tuesday during a Senate committee hearing on legislation to ban hog-dog competitions.\n\nHog-dog supporters argued that city folk had no place trying to ban a cherished piece of rural culture that they claim doesn't harm pigs or the dogs attempting to catch them.\n\nCountry folks should stop the \"brutal\" and \"sadistic\" competition and spend more time reading and writing, said Sen. Ken Hollis, R-Metairie.\n\nReferring to literature provided by supporters containing \"page after page\" of misspelled words, Hollis suggested that hog-dog supporters might benefit from spending more time around each other to improve their spelling skills."
