    "contenido": "KGB agents in scuba gear used to swim under Nikita Khrushchev's boat, putting fish on his hook. They used to chain wild boars to trees so Leonid Brezhnev could blast them with his hunting rifle; they used to hide behind trees to throw furry little rabbits out for Brezhnev to peer at through his thick eyeglasses and gun down.\n\nThis brings us to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, who took Air Force Two last week to an exclusive Pennsylvania club for some sport — Brezhnev-style. No boars chained to trees, no trembling pages clutching trembling rabbits to chuck like grenades into the line of fire. Just hundreds of clueless, farm-raised ring-necked pheasants, all held under nets until the vice president and his Texas Republican friends (investment bankers, a senator, former Dallas Cowboys football star Roger Staubach) are in position.\n\nThen the nets are lifted, the birds started and the gunfire opened. Cheney bagged more than 70; hundreds all told were killed. A senator who participated joked it was more like working at a poultry-processing plant than hunting. An outdoor writer compared it to \"going to the grocery store and buying chicken.\"\n\nAnimal rights activists called it slaughter for fun. The editor of Field & Stream shrugged, \"I don't think it should be confused with hunting.\"\n\nBut whether it's Cheney or Chernomyrdin, hunting this way is quick. Cheney's birds were plucked and vacuum-packed in time for his flight that afternoon to Washington (where, the official story goes, they were given to the poor). Cheney had no comment for the press, but you could easily imagine him echoing Chernomyrdin: \"I was happy that I had an opening in my schedule for this. I love hunting. There is no other recreation that I can afford. I am always short of time.\""
