    "contenido": "In diet books, bacon is often maligned as the antithesis of healthy eating. But among followers of the popular Atkins diet, it's hard to find anyone tearing a strip off the sizzle.\n\nBrian Burko is an Atkins-diet devotee who swears by his menu of six slices of bacon, four or five times a week.\n\n\"It doesn't really look like I'm on some terrible diet but over the last few months I've lost 35 pounds eating this way,\" he told CTV News.\n\n...\n\nMad cow disease and avian flu may partially explain why consumers are turning to pork, and away from beef and chicken.\n\nBut many believe the key ingredient is the craze for Atkins-inspired low-carb, high-protein diets, and the notion that fat is good again."
