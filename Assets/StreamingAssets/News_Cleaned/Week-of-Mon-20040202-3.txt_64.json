    "contenido": "Thank God for PETA.\n\nBefore you wildly search your home for tar and feathers, I am not a card-carrying PETA member. Nor do I concur with many of the group's \"extreme\" views or tactics. PETA's 2003 exhibit comparing factory-farmed animals to Holocaust victims was a bad idea.\n\nThat said, however, I still thank God for PETA — short for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.\n\nThe PETA folks have riled up more than a few ranchers and trappers, infuriated many a meat eater and hunter, and prompted outrage from Bible fundamentalists and game farm proprietors. They have crawled under the skin of those people who feel animals were put on this planet merely for human exploitation.\n\nThat's what they want to do. But PETA also does something else that hardly any other group does with any regularity:\n\nIt stands up for those that can't speak for themselves. It sticks its neck out. It takes chances. It displays a great deal of courage for a cause it profoundly believes in.\n\n...\n\nMcDonald's, Burger King, KFC, and Wendy's have all inaugurated animal welfare research programs. PETA also has been in the trenches in the battles against dogfighting and cockfighting.\n\n...\n\nThe commercial was a bit risqué, perhaps, but humorous and fairly tame when compared to the Super Bowl's halftime show and some of the other lackluster commercial spots. The gist of PETA's ad was that eating meat causes impotence. (You can view the 30-second ad at www.peta.org/feat/superbowl/.)\n\n...\n\nSubtly and slowly, but surely and assuredly, PETA is changing the American consciousness. At times, change is imperceptible.\n\nWe may view PETA's actions as outrageous and radical, hardly giving them a second thought.\n\nBut I can't help but ponder: A decade or two down the road, might we wonder what took us so long to understand?"
