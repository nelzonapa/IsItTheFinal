    "contenido": "If Debra Poneman could give parents one word of advice about a newly vegetarian child - well, it would be two words, but both would be most welcome.\n\n\"Stop worrying\" said the Evanston mother of two and author of What? No Meat? What to Do When Your Kid Becomes a Vegetarian (ECW Press, 2003).\n\nPoneman remembers well her mother's reaction when she, then a 17-year-old Skokie girl, announced her decision to renounce meat. \"Mom said, without missing a beat, 'That's nice, but Daddy has some skirt steaks on the grill, so why don't you wait and start tomorrow?'\"\n\n\"Well, I started 'tomorrow,' and now it's been 35 years,\" Poneman said, laughing, in a recent interview. And although her mother – like many parents – feared for her vegetarian daughter's health, it soon became apparent there was no need to worry."
