    "contenido": "They landed dramatically in the limelight recently after winning -- then losing -- a surprising contract in Washington, D.C., but the Humane Society of Canada and its CEO have for years found themselves the focus of controversy, criticism and legal conflict.\n\nThe society's deal to run Washington's animal shelter was cancelled last month after a local outcry against the agreement.\n\nSuch tension, though it has rarely surfaced publicly, has marked the organization's history almost since its birth a decade ago. Founded by the Humane Society of the United States in 1993, the Canadian society broke free three years later in what one judge referred to as a \"purported coup d'état\" by Michael O'Sullivan, the chief executive. The Americans responded with \"egregious\" behavior themselves, the judge noted.\n\nMore recently, some Canadian animal-welfare organizations have said the Humane Society of Canada's fundraising efforts — aided by its highly recognizable name — have diverted funds away from practical projects elsewhere, while the Society refuses to lay out exactly where its donations are spent. These critics say that the Society has no formal connections with most other humane societies in the country and that, while its Revenue Canada filings indicate it works solely in Canada, it seems to do much of its work overseas.\n\n\"The name [Humane Society of Canada] would lead the public to believe that he represents humane societies and that he is the national body, speaking on behalf of animal welfare, and yet he's not,\" complained Bob Van Tongerloo of the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies, an umbrella group.\n\n\"It's our organization that works with science, with research, with the livestock industry, with the federal government, and he's taking in funds that we cannot tell are being spent appropriately.\""
