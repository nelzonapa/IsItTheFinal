    "contenido": "Berlin - Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who as Soviet leader presided over the troops and tanks that guarded the Iron Curtain, now wants a nature reserve along the full length of the former Cold War border, from Finland to the Adriatic. German and other European environmental groups have devised a plan to create nature parks out of the no-man's land that separated the Soviet bloc from the West.\n\nKept forcibly free of people during more than 40 years of the Cold War, the border between Eastern and Western Europe became a refuge for plants and animals. Construction in the region now threatens these unintentional but important nature reserves, environmentalists fear. \"Ecology isn't something we can only leave to politicians,\" Mr. Gorbachev, who is president of the environmental organization Green Cross International, said when lending his support to the project at a recent conference in Bonn.\n\nEnvironmentalists stress that the reserve would not simply be the area it covered or the number of endangered species it contained but also that it would link many different groups of organisms, known as biotopes, in the longest continuous stretch of undeveloped land left in central Europe."
