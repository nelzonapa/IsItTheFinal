    "contenido": "If your menu for the December holidays always features prime rib or filet mignon, this could be the year to cook your first goose instead. Even opting to serve seven courses of fish, à la the Italian Christmas Eve tradition, might be easier on the wallet than buying beef for a crowd.\n\nBeef prices are soaring. At this time last year, live cattle traded at 64 cents per pound; now it's just over a dollar. And retail prices at some stores have shot up about 40 cents per pound.\n\nBut not all price tags reflect the increase. To protect consumers from sticker shock, some retailers are opting to absorb the extra cost, rather than raise prices. Or they might charge more for other items to make up the difference. Some restaurants are even steering customers toward other entrees. McDonald's and Wendy's, for example, are hyping salads and lean chicken pieces.\n\nBut they can't avoid raising beef prices for long, economists say.\n...\nAlso impacting the market is the ban on Canadian beef exports into the U.S., which went into effect in May as a result of one incident of mad cow disease in Alberta. Previously, about 8 percent of American beef came from Canada.\n\nAt the same time the beef supply has been reduced, diet gurus have boosted the appeal of red meat. Both the Atkins diet and the South Beach diet tout a high-protein, low-carbohydrate approach to weight loss. So people looking to shed a few pounds are ordering steak or a burger alongside their salad. And they're willing to pay top dollar."
