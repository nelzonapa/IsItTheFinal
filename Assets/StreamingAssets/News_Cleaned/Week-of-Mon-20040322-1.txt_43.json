    "contenido": "A US District Court judge will unseal a warrant and affidavit revealing why the FBI arrested a peace activist they never charged in connection with ecoterrorism in the San Gabriel Valley. Josh Connole's attorney says the decision by the US Attorney's Office to oppose the unsealing of the affidavits just 10 days after another man was charged is a \"tacit admission\" that the FBI arrested the wrong man the first time. Connole has fought to have the documents unsealed to clear his name in the Aug. 22 attacks, claiming the FBI has a history of \"smearing peace activists.\" \n\nConnole, 25, claims he was arrested because of his opposition to the Iraq war, and that the documents will show the FBI falsely arrested him. Caltech student and Pasadena resident William Cottrell, 23, has been indicted on nine counts connected with the arson and graffiti attacks that destroyed 133 vehicles and caused $3.5 million in damages. If convicted on all counts, he faces 35 years to life in federal prison.\n\nThe Earth Liberation Front, an international ecoterrorist group advocating economic sabotage to protect the environment, took credit for the attacks on sport utility vehicles at car dealerships and residences in the Valley, sparking a massive FBI investigation."
