    "contenido": "John Burton Wade won’t be returning to Mary Washington College this fall.\n\nA judge this week ruled that the freshman can take his exams and finish the school year— but then it’s straight to federal prison.\n\nWade, 19, of Henrico County, will serve a three-year sentence for his role in at least 10 environmental terrorist attacks in suburban Richmond during the summer and fall of 2002.\n\n...\nWade, along with co-conspirators Adam Blackwell and Aaron Linus, left notes at the scenes of the attacks, claiming they acted on behalf of the radical environmental group Earth Liberation Front.\n\nHowever, Wade says he wasn’t motivated by ELF and doesn’t consider himself a member.\n\n“Writing those at the scene was a convenient way to get our message across,” he said.\n\nInstead, he says he was inspired by Edward Abbey, author of “The Monkey Wrench Gang,” a book about four nature lovers who wage war on developers.\n\n“It’s basically a handbook for environmental terrorism,” Wade said."
