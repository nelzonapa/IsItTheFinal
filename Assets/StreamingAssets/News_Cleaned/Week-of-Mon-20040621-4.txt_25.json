    "contenido": "An animal rights group sued the state Attorney General's office yesterday, accusing it of violating public records laws by refusing to release some documents about the slaughter of cows at one of the state's largest meatpacking plants. In a lawsuit filed in Thurston County Superior Court, the Humane Farming Association alleged that state officials withheld information from their investigation into the association's complaint about the meatpacking plant. The organization, based in San Rafael, California, complained in 2000 that cows were being strung up and processed alive at the IBP plant in Wallula, now operated by Tyson Fresh Meats."
