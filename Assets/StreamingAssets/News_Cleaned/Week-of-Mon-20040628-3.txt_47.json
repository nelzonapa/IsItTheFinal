    "contenido": "Do all dogs go to heaven?\n\nIn some households, a dog's life could be considered paradise on Earth,\nwith an indulgent baby-boomer generation creating such institutions as\ndoggie day care, doggie spas, and doggie vacations.\n\nAnd the connection doesn't stop there? Witness the growth in pet\ncemeteries and sympathy cards for grieving animal owners.\n\nBut what about the next life?\n\nAs houses of worship respond by offering more services, such as the\nblessing of animals, speculation has increased on the afterlife of pets.\n\nSeveral books, Web sites, and religious services keep alive the memory of\npets and offer hope to owners that death will not separate them from\ntheir canine loved ones.\n\n...\n\nAnimal-rights advocates often point to the parable of the rich man and\nthe beggar in the 16th chapter in the Gospel of Luke. The rich man who\nfed sumptuously while the beggar sought scraps from his table ends up in\nhell. Would not the dogs who did not ignore the beggar but licked his sores\nin apparent comfort end up in heaven with the poor man? The Gospel does\nnot speak to that question.\n\nJust as human beings must wait to find out what the afterlife will be like,\nso, too, will the fate of pets remain a mystery in this life, many say.\n\nStill, it is important that clergy and theologians are talking about the\nissue, said Webb, author of \"On God and Dogs: A Christian Theology of\nCompassion for Animals.\""
