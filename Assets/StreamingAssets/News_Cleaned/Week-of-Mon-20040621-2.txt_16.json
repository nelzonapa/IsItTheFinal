After massive complaints from hunters and anglers, the pet food company Iams has ended a relationship with an anti-hunting animal rights organization.\n\nIn January, hunter advocate U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance alerted outdoorsmen that the Iams Co., maker of Iams and Eukanuba pet foods, joined forces with the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) as grand national sponsor of the Pet Fest America tour. The tour is a series of animal shows developed by HSUS.\n\nA flood of sportsmen's calls, faxes, and letters ensued, and in the end, Iams, a division of Proctor and Gamble, discontinued its support of the anti-hunters.\n\nIams conceded the feedback it received from sportsmen had a great deal to do with its decision to cut ties with the HSUS.\n\n\"We apologize for the frustration that this sponsorship has caused,\" the company wrote in a letter addressed to the U.S. Sportsmen's Alliance.\n\nAccording to the sportsmen's group, some of the nation's major consumer product and service firms, including General Mills, Accor Economy Lodging, Sears, and Ace Hardware, ended relationships with HSUS after thousands of sportsmen levied strong protests."
