    "contenido": "He 53-foot trailer shook as the 20 mares inside whinnied and stomped, restless and nervous after two days of captivity. Outside the trailer, horse lovers peered through the slats in the truck, eager to identify their mare.\n\nWith a makeshift ramp in place, the back of the trailer noisily creaked in the morning stillness as the first frightened-looking mares stepped out. They’re like mail-order brides,” said Nancy Riegler as she looked for the horse she recently adopted off the Internet. “I have looked at her picture so many times online that as soon as the truck pulled up and I caught a glimpse of her blaze, I knew it was her.”\n\nThe horses, most of them pregnant, had just traveled 1,800 miles from Alberta, Canada, to a ranch in Ramona, the Southern California headquarters of FoalQuest.\n\nThe mares had all come from farms that supply urine from pregnant mares to Wyeth Pharmaceutical, which uses it to manufacture the hormone replacement therapy, Premarin.\n\nSince 1999, the nonprofit FoalQuest organization has rescued and found homes for foals born to the mares. In October, the group also began finding homes for the mares when demand for Premarin dropped and the farms were forced to reduce their horse population by 40 percent. About 450 farms in western Canada and North Dakota keep as many as 40,000 horses for their urine production."
