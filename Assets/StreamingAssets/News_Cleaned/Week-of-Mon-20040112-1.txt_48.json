    "contenido": "A small black and white terrier mix spent five days caged up outdoors in 20-30 degree weather at the Park Hills pound with a dozen other dogs. The full-grown dog with no name would have been put to sleep in a couple more days if Diana Blackwell of the St. Francois Society hadn't picked it out of the bunch of dogs there. The animals there have just seven days at the Park Hills pound before they are put to sleep by a veterinarian. But some pounds in the area give animals even less time than that. Blackwell rescued the dog from the pound on Monday and gave her a temporary home with Tamara Madison of Park Hills. Madison, like 12 others in St. Francois County, is a foster parent for animals who have been saved by Blackwell and will be taken up to PetsMart stores in St. Louis for adoption. Blackwell, and a few volunteers like her, rescue stray animals from pounds and off the streets where the animals would eventually die."
