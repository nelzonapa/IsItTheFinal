    "contenido": "The wannabe Heydukes of the E. L. F. most recently claimed responsibility for $50 million in damage to a California real estate development. Apparently, some people in California were trying to replace massive tracts of untrammeled open space with pavement, heavily fertilized lawns, and hundreds of rows of nearly identical particle-board houses. Paving paradise and putting up a parking lot pisses off the people at E. L. F., so they torched it.\n\nUnfortunately, their extreme methods torched support for their cause, too.\n\nIf you're not aware, these are the same people who claimed responsibility for several fires on Vail Mountain that caused an estimated $12 million in damage in October of 1998. Beyond property damage, there were losses on a different level: several priceless photographs of Vail in its early days were destroyed, and all of the people who lived, worked, skied, and otherwise loved Vail Mountain were devastated and hurt to discover that a place we considered ours would be attacked and tagged as anti-environmental.\n\nBut just like Heyduke and the Gang, the short-sighted people from E. L. F. are not terrorists.\n\nIn an effort to condemn the E. L. F., good ol' U. S. Rep. Scott McInnis, R.-Grand Junction, is trying to elevate E. L. F.'s attacks to the level of terrorism.\n\nOh, boy. Here we go again."
