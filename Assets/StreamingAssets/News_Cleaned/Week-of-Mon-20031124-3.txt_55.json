    "contenido": "There is nothing I can do; we're on the point of no return. Sebastian's instructions resonate in my mind: \"If you fall, whatever happens, you mustn't let go of the sled.\" So here I am being dragged along face down in the snow, deep in the Yukon wilderness.\n\nThe trail is narrow and my team of dogs is weaving around the trees without any concern for its fallen musher. The sky is blue, the sun is shining, and everything is coated in snow, including me. The silence is shattered by my muffled laughter.\n\n\"Whooooooa!\" The team comes to a halt. I lie there, still hanging on while trying to locate the sled's anchor. A few inches away I can see the beautiful detail of peeling bark and snow crystals at the base of an aspen tree. Staring at this tiny detail, the scale of this vast landscape seems unimaginable.\n\nSpace, space, and more space— the Yukon lies between Alaska (to the west) and the vast expanse of the Canadian Arctic to the east. It's a two-hour flight north from Vancouver to the capital Whitehorse. It has a population of 31,000 (70% of whom live in Whitehorse), but it's also home to 185,000 caribou, 50,000 moose, and 17,000 bears.\n\nThe Yukon is also an awe-inspiring playground for adventurous types, though the range of activities includes plenty that are far from gung-ho. In winter, one of the best ways to explore is to use the network of dogsled and snowmobile trails, many of which follow the traditional trapping lines of the indigenous people.\n\nCall of the wild: the best way to explore the Yukon is by sled."
