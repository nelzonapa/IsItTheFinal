    "contenido": "As most of our longtime readers know, Watertown was once the capital of the stuffed geese industry. At one time, hundreds upon hundreds of geese were stuffed here in Watertown, and most then found their way to New York City where the liver was considered a delicacy.\n\nThe process was a time-consuming one. Geese were force-fed noodles several times a day, including a night feeding. This constant feeding fattened the birds and livers became enlarged. These enlarged livers were the basis for pâté de foie gras, which was served in such fine restaurants as Luchow's, which was located in the heart of New York City, until it was destroyed in a fire in 1995.\n\n...\n\nAlthough that industry died in Watertown about a quarter of a century ago, it has not completely ended. It's still being practiced in fashionable California where these livers are still considered a delicacy.\n\nOne of our readers alerted us to a short article in Time magazine this fall which recounted some mischief created by a band of environmental activists who are deeply opposed to the practice because it's inhumane. The article was written by Terry McCarthy.\n\n...\n\nCounters Sarah Jane Blum, a spokeswoman for Gourmet Cruelty.org: \"If this were being done to dogs or cats, the producers would without a doubt be in prison for animal cruelty!\"\n\n...\"\n\nWe'll leave it up to our readers as to whether this is cruelty to animals but we're thinking Watertown's place in foie gras lore can't be all wrong.\n\n...\n\nRight now, about the only thing remaining from that once-flourishing industry is the Watertown High School mascot, the \"Gosling.\" That name came from the goose noodling industry here.\n\nWe thought this story was an appropriate one, given that there's been a pretty big focus on food this week with the Thanksgiving festivities."
