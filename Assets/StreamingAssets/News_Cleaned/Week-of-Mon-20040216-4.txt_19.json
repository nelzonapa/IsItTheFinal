    "contenido": "The drive to secure a British ban on live exports of horses, ponies and donkeys took a major step forward yesterday with signs of support from the European Commission.\n\nSouth West Tory MEP Neil Parish is hopeful that his lobbying for a British ban on live exports could be successful.\n\nMr Parish has persuaded Dutch MEP Albert Maat, who is putting forward legislation on the transport of animals within the European Union, to include an amendment which would maintain Britain's \"minimum values\" legislation.\n\nThis protects low value horses, ponies and donkeys from the horror of live transport by pushing their value just above the meat value of the animals, so that they will not be transported live for slaughter.\n\nLast night Mr Parish said his call for the minimum values ruling to stay in place had received a positive reception.\n\n\"It would be silly to say we have achieved a ban, but this is very positive news,\" he said.\n\n\"We are a long way down the road to getting the right legislation. I got some very positive answers from the European Commission about the derogation.\"\n\nHis optimism that the ban on live exports can be retained comes only a few weeks after Defra Minister Alun Michael, who has described himself as \"Minister for the Horse\", sparked outrage by refusing to lobby the EU on the matter. Mr Michael said he would not push the EU to close the loophole which would end the British ban on live exports."
