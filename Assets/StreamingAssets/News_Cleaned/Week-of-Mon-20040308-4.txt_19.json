    "contenido": "Can you imagine hooking your dog up to a sled with 15 other dogs, and running them in four-to-five hour stretches for nine-to-twelve continuous days in an 1,150-mile race? That would be the approximate distance between Asheville, NC, and Bangor, ME. Under the best of circumstances, this would be grueling, but add to the mix sub-zero temperatures, arctic winds, snowstorms, and ice. This is the Iditarod.\n\nMost of us would consider such brutal treatment to be animal cruelty punishable by law, but the Iditarod is Alaska's biggest \"sporting event,\" and is supported by major corporations. Organizers discount the 120 recorded dog deaths as just a tiny fraction of the animals that run. The \"I-Killed-a-Dog\" race has a death rate of 2.9 fatalities for every 1,000 competitors, which is the mathematical equivalent of 290 deaths in the Boston Marathon during the last decade. Susan Butcher, a four-time winner of the Iditarod, has publicly stated, \"We [dog mushers] wouldn't as a group, pass anybody's idea of humane treatment of animals.\"\n\n...\n\nJon Saraceno, a sports writer for USA Today, stated, \"It is the most immoral, reprehensible'sporting event' in the USA.\" Other sports writers have had equally disparaging remarks about the Iditarod. You can help to end this brutal race by writing to the sponsors. Go to www.helpsleddogs.org for contact information. Major corporations have dropped their sponsorships of the race after hearing from the public about the brutal treatment of the dogs."
