    "contenido": "NEAH BAY — The TV footage has been replayed over and over again.\n\nA gray whale gliding near the Makah canoe, puffing mist into the air as it surfaces.\n\nThe huge harpoon going in.\n\nThe whale recoiling, fleeing.\n\nA speedboat pulling alongside and firing several shots that explode in the sea.\n\nMore harpoons, more shots.\n\nThe whale thrashing, rolling.\n\nThe harpoon lines going slack. The sea filling with blood.\n...\nFive years later, intense reactions to the Makah killing its only gray whale since the late 1920s have reverberated with court cases and environmental requirements— which have effectively stopped any new whale hunts since 2000.\n...\n``It looks like the animal rights people got us where we wanted us,'' Makah Whaling Commission Vice President Arnie Hunter said in an interview with the Peninsula Daily News last week.\n...\nThe judges also ruled that a full environmental impact assessment must be conducted, rather than a less involved environmental assessment, to determine the impact of whaling on the whale population in the area of the hunt off the tribe's Neah Bay reservation.\n\nThe court was ruling on a lawsuit filed by the Fund for Animals, the Humane Society of the United States, Washington Citizen's Coastal Alliance leader Dan Spomer of Sekiu, Chuck Owens of Joyce, co-founder of Peninsula Citizens for the Protection of Whales, and other groups and individuals.\n\nWhale hunts have also been opposed by some of the 1,800 members of the tribe."
