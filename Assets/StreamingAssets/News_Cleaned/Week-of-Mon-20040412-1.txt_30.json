    "contenido": "A potential settlement in a legal battle over foie gras production could mean some trespassing allegations are dropped from a suit against animal rights activists who say the delicacy is made by torturing ducks, one of the defendants said Tuesday.\n\nIn return, the activists would drop the owner of Sonoma Foie Gras and his wife as defendants in a separate animal cruelty suit.\n\nNo settlement has been reached, and attorneys on either side of the dueling lawsuits -- which have pitted vegan activists against Sonoma restaurateur Guillermo Gonzalez, who runs one of two foie gras farms in the country -- would say little, citing the ongoing discussions.\n\nBut Bryan Pease, one of several activists who have acknowledged repeatedly breaking into Gonzalez's Sonoma Foie Gras' farm in San Joaquin County last year, said the settlement would mean the trespass allegations against him and his co-defendants would be dropped."
