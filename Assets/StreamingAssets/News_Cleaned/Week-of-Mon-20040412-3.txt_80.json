    "contenido": "Criminal trespassing charges have been filed against a federal wolf recovery official and another man who were found with four wolves on a private ranch. The men may have accidentally landed their helicopter on private land on February 14 to place radio tracking collars on four wolves that had been tranquilized, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service officials have said. Park County Attorney Bryan Skoric said biologist Michael Jimenez of the Fish and Wildlife Service and Wesley Livingston of Hawkins and Powers Aviation each faced two counts: trespassing and placing or depositing objects upon the property of another, which is more commonly known as littering, according to a statement released through his office. Both are misdemeanor counts that carry maximum penalties of up to $750 in fines and up to six months in jail, he said. The statement did not specify what items were considered to be litter. Jimenez, the wolf recovery project leader for Wyoming, did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment on Friday."
