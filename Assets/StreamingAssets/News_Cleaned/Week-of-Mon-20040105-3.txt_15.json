    "contenido": "Meanwhile, extreme cold weather puts extra stress on pets, but it can be managed for their health and comfort, said local veterinarian Linda Perry.\n\n\"You just need to pay attention to food, water and shelter,\" she said. \"More food, warmer water and extra shelter.\"\n\nAnimals, including larger ones like horses and cattle, need an increased amount of energy, which means more food \"to keep their furnaces running hot,\" Perry said.\n\nA tank heater helps by keeping stock water warmer, so animals can drink more, stay warmer and avoid dehydration. Larger animals will also gain from a windbreak from the chill and blowing snow, she said.\n\n\"Preferably, dogs would be kept inside in this weather, at least in a garage or some sheltered area where they're completely enclosed,\" Perry said. \"The dog houses just don't really keep them that warm when the temperature's this cold. And if they are outside, they can benefit from extra food also to generate internal heat.\"\n\nDogs that lack a winter coat or build for this kind of weather should not be outside, she said. Dogs seem to love it, but riding in the backs of pickup trucks when it's this cold can expose them to brutal wind chills, Perry said.\n\nCats, too, should be afforded protection from the elements, warm water sources and access to food to meet their intake requirements, she said. Older dogs, especially, with arthritis may benefit from heating blankets or beds. Pet owners may want to speak with their veterinarian about using anti-inflammatory treatments, she said.\n\nCold stresses the body and can lower immunities, Perry said."
