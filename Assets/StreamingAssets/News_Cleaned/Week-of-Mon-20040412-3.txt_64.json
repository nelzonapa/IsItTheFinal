    "contenido": "Palm Beach — TJ and Neil Fisher hired an ex-CIA agent and offered $10,000 to find the person who’s shooting and killing cats with a high-powered pellet gun. But that’s not enough in the pricey neighborhood on the 100 block of Seminole Avenue, where mansions go for millions. Now, the couple has upped the offer to $25,000. They hope someone will offer information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person who pumped three pellets into Karuki, the one-eyed orange tomcat the Fishers adopted last year."
