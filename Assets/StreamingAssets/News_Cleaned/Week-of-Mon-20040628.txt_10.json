    "contenido": "When Wanda and Winky, two female Asian elephants at the Detroit Zoo, are transplanted, most likely to a sanctuary in the South, they may be the first elephants relocated by a major animal facility for humane reasons.\n\n\"We now more fully understand an elephant's needs,\" Ron Kagan, director of the Detroit Zoological Institute, said in a May 20 statement. \"Just as polar bears don't thrive in hot climates, Asian elephants shouldn't live in small groups without many acres to roam. They clearly shouldn't have to suffer winters of the North.\"\n\nThe animal welfare ethic is emerging more prominently, says Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States. It used to be that basically you were just showcasing animals for the visitors. But over time, he said, we've \"seen the mission expand... to include animals' welfare.\""
