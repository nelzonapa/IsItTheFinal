And when I realized one could look gorgeous without wearing fur, of course! You know I am now a major contributor to SPOMA [Society for the Prevention of Misuse of Animals]. Collie [SPOMA director Catherine Carnes] is one of my dearest friends.\n\nDo you support other animal rights groups like PETA? What do you think about more forceful advocates like ELF, AJL, and SPEAC?\n-- Don Rabinowitz, New York\n\nI think I need some alphabet soup to figure them all out! But really dear, I support SPOMA, but I don't like violent groups. I'm against violence towards any animal and people are just another kind of animal.\n...\nDo you have any pets, besides Lily, that is?\n-- Donna Ghostley, Richmond\n\nI have an enormous tropical fish habitat at home. I love tropical fish! And they are very well cared for. Mr. Kim, my supplier, is always checking up on how they are doing. I have the most wonderful Zebra fish and rays and arrowanas.\n[Luella Vedric and her poodle Lily at a SPOMA fundraiser. John Hammer, Tamarack News Service]"
