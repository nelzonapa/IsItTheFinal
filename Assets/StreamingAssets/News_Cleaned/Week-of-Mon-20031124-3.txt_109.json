    "contenido": "Hefty fines and other tougher penalties await Marlborough dog owners who breach new dog control laws which come into force on Monday.\n\nFines of up to $1000 are a feature of the new laws. Owners of \"menacing\" dog breeds will need to have them muzzled in public. From next week, the Marlborough District Council will be enforcing higher penalties, including $300 fines for roaming dogs and a $500 fine for people not picking up after their dog has pooped in public.\n\nCouncil reserves and amenities supervisor Russell Montgomery said the council had lobbied hard to have the fines reduced from $500 to $300 for impounding dogs as well as removing \"draconian\" laws requiring people to fence off accessways to their properties. He said the laws were now something they could work with but he would have liked to see fines a little lower because they would be simply unaffordable for many people.\n\nHe said it was now important that dogs had their tags attached because they would be impounded otherwise. Responsible owners had nothing to fear from the new laws but Mr Montgomery said irresponsible people would have to \"wake up to the new rules\" or face the extra expense.\n\nBlenheim dog owner Karen Middlemiss said she enjoyed walking her dog along the Taylor River and did not see any problems with the new laws. She was aware of the need to carry a dog lead but said most people she met on her walks would carry one anyway if they did not trust their dog to \"socialize\".\n\n\"We have never had a problem with other dogs down there,\" she said. \"We have doggy-do bags provided by the council in designated walking areas, and they've really helped keep things clean.\"\n\nMiddlemiss added: \"I think we're going to get used to these new rules eventually. It's just part of life here now.\""
