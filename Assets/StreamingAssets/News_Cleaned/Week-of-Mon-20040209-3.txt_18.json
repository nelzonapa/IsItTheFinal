The local society has now hit the wall after struggling for two years with changes imposed by the B.C. Gaming Commission and the B.C. SPCA organization. \"The idea of it closing is just heartbreaking,\" said Jena Peori, who has been both an SPCA volunteer and part-time employee. SPCA stalwart Cathie Newman said the problem first surfaced two years ago. That's when they started using their reserves to help them... and then were told by SPCA head office they couldn't use them anymore. Before 2002, Salt Spring's SPCA applied for and usually received grants from the B.C. Gaming Commission, said Newman. Combined with islanders' donations and income generated from reserves, the SPCA could cover its costs. But gaming commission rules changed in 2002, so that only the head office of the SPCA could apply for a grant, which was capped at $250,000 - about one-quarter of the total all branches received the year before. The branch's 2003 deficit was forgiven by head office, but the group was advised that would not be done again. So this is why we have to raise the money on the island, said Newman."
