    "contenido": "Vienna – Hollywood has portrayed them as muscle-bound and handsome but Austrian anthropologists have found evidence suggesting that Roman gladiators were fat vegetarians who bore scant resemblance to Russell Crowe.\n\nThe scientists did tests on skeletons of two different types of gladiators—myrmillos and retiariae—found at the ancient site of Ephesus, near Selcuk in Turkey.\n\nTests performed on bits of bone taken from the skeletons of some 70 gladiators buried at Ephesus seem to prove that they ate mainly barley, beans, and dried fruit, according to Karl Grossschmidt, a forensic doctor who participated in the study by Austria’s Institute of Archaeology.\n\nThis diet, which has been mentioned in the oral history, is rather sad but it gave the gladiators a lot of strength even if it made them fat, said Grossschmidt, who is a member of Vienna’s Institute of Histology and Embryology.\n\nThe Austrian paleoanthropologists relied on a method known as elementary micro-analysis that allows scientists to determine what a human being ate during his lifetime.\n\nA balanced diet of meat and vegetables leaves equal amounts of zinc and strontium in the cells, while a mainly vegetarian diet would leave high levels of strontium and little zinc, Grossschmidt said.\n\nThe bone density here was higher than usual, as is the case with modern athletes, said Fabian Kanz from the department of analytical chemistry at Vienna University.\n\nIt seems that the gladiators tried to put on some weight before their battles, Kanz said. But this does not mean that they did not work hard to lose it again once they stepped out of the ring, he added with a smile."
