    "contenido": "Encounters between humans and wildlife will likely increase as development shrinks the buffer between city and wildland. How well we handle such encounters will reflect our level of responsibility, education, and engagement with wildlife policies, according to a panel of experts who convened at the Arizona Daily Star this month.\n\nIncidents involving individual animals often capture public attention but require a broader perspective. Naturalist and writer Jonathan Hanson emphasizes that the health of the entire species matters more than any single animal. He suggests that lobbying for more mountain lion habitat could be more effective than reacting emotionally to individual killings. Wildlife biologist Lisa Haynes agrees, stating that a healthy mountain lion population benefits the ecosystem as a whole, including human populations. The greatest threat to mountain lions in the future is urban sprawl, she notes, citing bulldozers as a significant factor."
