    "contenido": "You know, all the recent news about mad cow disease has made me hungry. And, apparently, I'm not the only one.\n\nBut I'm hungry for a big, juicy T-bone and a baked potato, not a cow brain sandwich.\n\nEven though the cows have begun to go mad here in the United States, people refuse to give up their cow brain sandwiches.\n\nThat's right. Take Evansville, Ind., for instance, where noggin noshin' is a tradition.\n\n...\nBut, it's not just in Indiana. No.\n\nIn Stockton, Calif., cow brains are commonly sold as - oh... my... gawd - taco filling and sold from the back end of some of the finest pickup truck restaurants on the West Coast.\n\n...\nIn Kentucky, eating squirrel brains served with fried eggs was once considered a rural delicacy. Its popularity declined, however, after researchers in 1997 found a possible link between eating squirrel brains and contracting mad cow disease. Plus, ya gotta kill a heck of a lot of squirrels before you have enough brains to add to that favorite Squirrel Helper recipe.\n\n...\nConsidering that mad cow disease - or bovine spongiform encephalopathy - eats holes in your brain and is incurable and fatal, you'd think that would be a really big turnoff. But we Americans consider ourselves to be indestructible. In fact, we cannot be killed and are immortal. And really, really stupid.\n\nThose who do the whole deep-frying thing think they're safe. They figure deep-frying will kill any bits of crazy cow on their Medulla Oblongata de Cristo sandwich.\n\nWell, bad news, Sparky. Cow brains have to be cooked to about 1,200 degrees to kill the rogue proteins called prions that cause the disease."
