    "contenido": "Alaska State Troopers arrived at a Soldotna musher's house last week to find 15 dogs chained to their doghouses, no food or water in sight, ribs showing through the layers of their husky fur.\n\nTroopers plan to return the dogs to their owner, Sigmund Stormo, who had paid a distant relative $10 per day to look after the dogs while he was away at a remote site on Kodiak Island for work. The relative, whom troopers will not name, allegedly failed to fulfill this duty, potentially leaving the dogs without food or water for up to 10 days."
