Although he already put in a full day at the office and was tired, Wenzel had a hunch something was brewing and had to be out there. Barely an hour passed when Wenzel heard three shots break the silence down the road. With his windows down, he heard the exhaust of a truck rumbling toward him. The truck stopped in front of Wenzel, unaware of his hidden state vehicle, and a spotlight illuminated a fat four-point buck. As Wenzel watched, another shot rang out from the truck and the buck collapsed."
