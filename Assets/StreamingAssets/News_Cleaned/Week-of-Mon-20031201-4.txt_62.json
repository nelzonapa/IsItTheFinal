    "contenido": "The 880-pound bull buffalo that Bud Koeppen has dubbed Big Bad John raised his head and cast a wary look at the men standing on the other side of the electrified fence.\n\nLooking into the eyes of a bison, the largest animal native to North America, is likely to inspire thankfulness for fences, electricity, and the safety they provide, but Big Bad John, who is less than a year old, seemed more interested in the movements of Annie, the more inquisitive of Koeppen's two dogs.\n\nKoeppen and his brother and business partner, Wally, are still adjusting to the fact that the Brokenwagon Bison Ranch has moved from the planning and construction stage to reality.\n\nThe buffalo have been roaming for just a week on the 150-acre pasture on the Wheeler farm, once owned by their parents, Clarence and Myrtle Koeppen.\n\nTheir bison herd, acquired at an auction in Lewiston, Minnesota, includes one bull, two calves, and seven cows, each of which is expected to deliver a calf in the spring. When they bought their animals, they were unsure how many they could load into the cattle trailer belonging to their friend, John Williams. As it turned out, they would have had room for another cow or two more calves."
