    "contenido": "Is it time for the Lincoln Park Zoo to forget elephants?\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals thinks so. \"Life in captivity is harmful for elephants -- for their psychological and physical well-being,\" said PETA elephant specialist Nicole Meyer.\n\nWhat do you expect from PETA, right? But other zoos are taking the same position.\n\n\"It's becoming clear that the disparity between what elephants need and what they get in captivity is quite significant,\" said Ron Kagan, director of the Detroit Zoo, which is dropping its elephant exhibit.\n\nThe San Francisco Zoo is also closing its elephant exhibit.\n\nHmm...\n\nThe debates -- with lovers of animals on both sides -- will go on a while. But at least there is this: Once the elephant matter is settled, one way or another, the zoos can rest easier.\n\n\"Well, there are some similar challenges,\" said Kagan of the Detroit Zoo. \"The same case can be made for dolphins and killer whales.\""
