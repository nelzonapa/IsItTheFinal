    "contenido": "Walk into Waukesha County Sheriff and Genesee Depot resident Dan Trawicki's office and you'll notice right away what his biggest hobby is: hunting. \n\nA large stuffed turkey faces the doorway, puffed out in all its splendor and inviting you to take a look at all the pictures adorning the wall next to it: pictures of Trawicki and relatives with turkeys, ducks, deer and fish, all freshly killed or caught.\n\nThis is a relatively normal sight for anyone who's lived in Wisconsin for more than a few years. Hunting? Yeah, sure, old hat, right?\n\nThat's when you might turn around.\n\nOn the opposite wall hang several pictures featuring Trawicki again smiling next to his prey, yet the animals are decidedly different. Lions, elephants, rhinoceroses and impalas are all there, next to him in each shot, inanimate trophies. It seems that Trawicki is a bit more into hunting than your average guy.\n\n\"I'm a big hunter – our family’s a big hunter – I’m a big shooter,\" Trawicki said, while proudly showing a picture of his daughter Abby, a 10-year-old fourth-grader at Rose Glen Elementary, next to a wildebeest she shot in Africa. \"She likes to hunt. She likes to shoot.\""
