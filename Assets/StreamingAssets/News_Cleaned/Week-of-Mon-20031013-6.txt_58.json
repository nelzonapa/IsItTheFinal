    "contenido": "Rhinelander – Beneath a cluster of stumps spread over a grassy flat, the fungi are finishing the job, completing the annihilation of much of a life’s work.\n\nFor 18 years, U.S. Forest Service researcher Don Riemenschneider had raised and documented 500 poplars, devoting such attention to them that the trees became, he said, like his children. Over the decades, his technical and time-consuming labors to breed resistance to a certain cottonwood canker went largely unwatched.\n\nExcept, that is, by the “Elves.”\n\nIn the darkness of July 20, 2000, members of the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) crept onto the grounds of the Rhinelander Forest Service research station and mauled the trees that Riemenschneider had known since they were buds.\n...\nThese activists, condemned by much of the mainstream environmental movement and belonging to such groups as ELF, the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) and a newly emerging group calling itself Revolutionary Cells, have claimed responsibility for bombing research laboratories, torching posh housing developments, releasing animals, cutting brake lines, and sending razors and threats to those whom they consider ideological enemies.\n...\nIn recent weeks, California animal-rights activist Rick Bogle, who lived for a time in the 1990s in Jefferson, Wis., sent threatening emails to several researchers at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center in Madison, suggesting that they be jailed.\n\n“Greetings slime: No clearer example of evil incarnate exists than the informed decision to use other primates in hurtful experimentation,” he wrote. “... Your elimination is justified.”\n\nIn a phone interview, Bogle acknowledged sending the email to hundreds of researchers. He said the animal-rights movement has been radicalized by frustration that many elements of the research community and the corporate world — in the activists’ view — fail to act ethically, and by the public’s failure to take notice."
