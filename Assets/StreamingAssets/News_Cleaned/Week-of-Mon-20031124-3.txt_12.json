    "contenido": "It's 6:15 a.m., Nov. 20, and cold -- or at least, as cold as November mornings in Orlando get. The temperature has dipped into the low 50s, and we're standing in the parking lot of the University of Central Florida Arena, anxiously awaiting the warmth of a chartered bus due here 45 minutes ago. With me is a writer from the Central Florida Future, about 35 student activists from the school's campus. Peace.ACTION group, and two older women sporting Dennis Kucinich T-shirts.\n\n\"Lousy union labor!\" one student yells, a reference to the missing bus. He's shot a look of remonstration, and recants: \"I'm just joshing.\"\n\nWe're not the only ones growing impatient. Channel 13 sent a reporter out to film the students getting on the bus, and she's now behind schedule. While we wait, Peace.ACTION leader Emily Ruff passes around a release form that includes a space for next of kin.\n\n\"What's it for?\" one student asks.\n\n\"If you get arrested,\" Ruff responds.\n\n\"Not if, when,\" another student chimps in, and the group laughs.\n\nRuff instructs us to break into groups of two or three — the buddy system — and gives us gauze, bandages, and latex gloves. One student activist is commended for having a poster that's not attached to a carrying stick: Sticks can be considered weapons, I'm told, and where we're going, having such a weapon could get you beaten or tear-gassed. Another student uses red tape to fashion a cross on the front and back of his white sweater. He will be the group medic."
