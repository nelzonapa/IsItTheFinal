    "contenido": "Ten months after his death, diet guru Robert Atkins is at the center of more controversy. A medical report showing he was obese when he died has been seized on by Atkins opponents with their own views to promote. In stake is control of the $40 billion-a-year diet industry and the profits of America's food giants.\n\nFor a man who changed millions of lives, Robert Atkins' own end was an awful mess. Last April, he slipped on an icy pavement, banged his head, suffered (possibly) a heart attack, then went into a coma from which he never emerged. He died within a week.\n\n...\n\nTo enemies of the Atkins diet, it looked like a heinous cover-up at the expense of the ill-fed and the credulous, and yesterday these enemies had their chance to gloat. It turns out that Atkins died obese, with a history of heart disease and a score of 35 on a standard index that put him 10 points over merely overweight. To us, says a spokeswoman for a group of American doctors called Physicians' Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM), the significance is that we've been saying for years and years that the Atkins diet is a diet that's likely to cause heart disease.\n\nBut what is the PCRM? Where did it get its information about Dr. Atkins' corpse? And is this argument really about a global public health emergency, or something altogether simpler? Determined dieters who've spent small fortunes trying weight-loss programs from both ends of the medical opinion spectrum may have an idea of the answer.\n\nThe PCRM is a fiercely anti-meat, pro-vegetarian brain trust that has opposed the Atkins diet for years, apparently with the best of intentions. It obtained its information on Dr. Atkins' body from Dr. Richard Fleming, a Nebraska-based cardiologist, outspoken critic of the Atkins diet and author of two high-profile books on how to minimize your risk of heart disease without a high-protein diet.\n\n...\n\nThis feud is about business. This is not to say it isn't also about health, but it does emphasize with the concision of a fine haiku that in America, and increasingly here too, health is business."
