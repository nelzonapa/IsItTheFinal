    "contenido": "After receiving complaints about aggressive and barking dogs, members of the Jefferson County Commission have decided to study the types of laws they can pass to control the problem. One county resident complained about barking dogs at last Thursday night's commission meeting and Commissioner Greg Corliss said he has received several phone calls from residents complaining about aggressive dogs. Corliss said he would like to see the county pass a law dealing with barking, vicious, and unleashed dogs.\n\nThe commissioners are reviewing dog-control laws that have been passed recently in Berkeley County, Corliss said. On August 28, the Berkeley County Commission put the final touches on a barking dog ordinance that carries a $100 fine for a first-time offense. Subsequent offenses carry up to a $250 fine under the law, which will take effect October 1."
