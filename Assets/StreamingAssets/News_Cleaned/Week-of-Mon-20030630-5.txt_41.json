    "contenido": "A serial cat killer is stalking the West.\n...\nIt makes you wonder what kind of cruel, diabolical, psychopathic monster could perpetrate such heinous acts.\nAnd it makes you wonder: Does Bill Frist have an alibi?\nBill Frist - you know who that is. He's a U.S. Senator from Tennessee who took over the Senate Majority Leader position from Sen. Trent Lott, R-KKK. He's also a cardiac surgeon. He became famous when he raced from the Senate to treat a crazed gunman who had stormed the Capitol and killed two Capitol police officers.\n...\nIn his 1989 autobiography, Transplant: A Heart Surgeon's Account of the Life and Death Dramas of the New Medicine, Frist describes his education at the Harvard Medical School, an education that included dissecting animals."
