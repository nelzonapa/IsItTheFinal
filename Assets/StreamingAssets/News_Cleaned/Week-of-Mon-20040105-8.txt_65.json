    "contenido": "Ranchers will suffer lower cattle prices \"for some time to come\" due to the first U.S. case of mad cow disease, despite America's unwavering appetite for hamburgers, steaks, ribs, and roasts, according to the head of the largest U.S. farm group. The U.S. response to mad cow disease was expected to dominate the annual meeting of the 5.5 million-member American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), held here. Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman will speak via satellite at the convention on Monday. \n\nVeneman stated that the Canadian system, managed by the cattle industry, proved invaluable in tracking down infected cows. Canada reported its first native case of mad cow on May 20, making it the birthplace of the U.S. case.\n\nAn Oregon farmer told Veneman that a dairy cow from Washington state had been born in Canada, indicating that they would never have found her otherwise. \n\nFederal, state, and industry officials are currently drafting a U.S. animal identification plan that aims to take its first steps this summer. The plan includes the issuance of identification numbers for farms, ranches, and feedlots. This process will begin in early 2005.\n\nAccording to Veneman, with cattle ID, \"we saved the slaughter, we think, of 10,000 cattle\" through accurate tracing during mad cow investigations. In comparison, U.S. officials ordered the slaughter of a herd of 450 bull calves because they couldn't be certain which one was the offspring of the infected cow in Washington state."
