The woman said it was intended for a traditional wedding reception of some African immigrants.\n\"It was obviously a monkey, but we couldn't identify the species,\" said Patricia Rogers, a federal wildlife agent at the airport.\nIn August, two large monkey heads seized from a passenger arriving in Atlanta from Senegal apparently were intended for consumption by a family of immigrants, authorities said.\nAirport inspectors from New York to Hawaii are reporting similar findings as a demand for \"bush meat,\" or wild animal flesh, mostly from Africa, increases in the United States. \"We're probably seeing only the tip of the iceberg,\" said Mike Elkins, deputy wildlife agent in charge at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's regional office in Atlanta."
