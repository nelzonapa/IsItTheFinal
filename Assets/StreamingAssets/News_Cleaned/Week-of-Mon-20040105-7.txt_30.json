    "contenido": "Carol Flaig of Junction City took the family cat to be declawed in early December. She was one of the first pet owners in the area to use the new technology that makes trips to the veterinarian less painful.\n\n\"The first couple of days she was sleeping it off like they usually do,\" Flaig said. \"After that she was already getting back into trouble.\"\n\nFor about a month, a carbon dioxide laser has been used for most types of surgeries needed by dogs, cats and other small animals at Marshfield Veterinary Service, 916 N. Central Ave., said Tammy Hofstad, small animal veterinarian.\n\nAlthough the technology has been available in larger referral veterinary clinics, Marshfield Veterinary Service's CO2 laser is the first of its kind for local pets, Hofstad said.\n\nBefore the vet clinic acquired the laser equipment, people were calling and asking for it, she said."
