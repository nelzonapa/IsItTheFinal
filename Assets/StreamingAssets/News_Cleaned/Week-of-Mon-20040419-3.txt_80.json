    "contenido": "RAMONA Penny Scott brushed one of two mares that had been shipped from Alberta, Canada, to her Ramona ranch this year. Motioning to a stocky, tricolor paint horse grazing on alfalfa, she said, \"I call her Destiny, because she's going to have one. She's not going to end up in some place.\"\n\nIt's hard for Scott to articulate where Destiny might have wound up had she not intervened. Perhaps on a restaurant menu.\n\nScott is the Southern California representative for FoalQuest, an organization that rescues mares and foals that might otherwise become part of this country's $25 million-a-year horse meat export industry. The rescued horses come from Canadian farms, where the urine of pregnant mares is collected and sold to Wyeth Pharmaceutical, which uses it to make Premarin, a drug used in hormone replacement therapy. After the mares give birth in the spring, their foals are largely disposable.\n\n...\n\nOrganizations such as PETA say NAERIC and FoalQuest are \"corporate apologists\" financed by Wyeth.\n\n\"I think the FoalQuest site is a mouthpiece for the industry,\" said Mary Beth Sweetland, director of research and investigations for PETA. \"No one who cares about animals could promote Premarin, regardless of how well the horses are cared for, because it all leads to exploitation.\"\n\n\"We think Premarin is dying a natural death,\" Sweetland said. \"Maybe it's the fact that women were downing horse urine rather than hormones that are natural to the human body.\""
