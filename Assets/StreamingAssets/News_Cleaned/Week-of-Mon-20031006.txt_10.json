    "contenido": "The Cuyahoga Valley National Park soon will begin a study on white-tailed deer that could lead to sharpshooters killing the animals, perhaps in two years.\n\nThe National Park Service intends to begin the 18- to 24-month study later this year, park Superintendent John Debo said.\n\nThe deer problem in the Cuyahoga Valley has not gone away, he said, and officials feel the herd must be reduced to protect the park's plants and animals.\n\n\"We still have a very high deer population in parts of the valley,\" he said. \"... The problem is as real as it was a few years ago.\"\n\nThe study — called an environmental impact statement — will include considerable public participation in formulating a deer-management plan for the 33, 000-acre park.\n\nDebo said it's presumptuous to say that sharpshooters will be used because the upcoming federal study will consider \"all feasible alternatives\" for reducing deer numbers.\n\nIn 1997, park officials wanted to use sharpshooters to kill 470 deer. But that effort was blocked by a federal judge in Washington, D. C., after animal-rights activists sued to stop the killing.\n\nU. S. District Judge Paul Friedman said the park service had failed to make a convincing case that shooting deer would not have a negative impact.\n\nAt least two national animal rights' groups are keeping an eye on what happens in the Cuyahoga Valley park.\n\nHeidi Prescott, national director for the New York-based Fund for Animals, one of the groups involved in the 1997 suit, intends to ask the fund's lawyers to closely review the park service plans.\n\n\"We're still interested in opposing hunting in the national park,\" she said. \"Hunting is only a Band-Aid approach to controlling the deer population.\""
