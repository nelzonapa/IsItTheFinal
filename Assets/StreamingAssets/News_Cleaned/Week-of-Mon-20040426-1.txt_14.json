    "contenido": "State lawmakers have been offered free tickets to see the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus Sunday at Albany's Pepsi Arena, courtesy of the producer of the show, Feld Entertainment Inc.\n\nIf they were around Albany last Friday, they could have seen another free show, this one meant to demonstrate the cruelty circus animals allegedly endure. A male and female representative of the group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, body-painted to look like leopards, crouched virtually naked inside metal cages across from the Capitol in a cold, misty rain for an hour.\n\nKayla Worden, of Asheville, N.C., a 42-year-old actress and model who now works for PETA, wore only pasties and panties, while 35-year-old Kristo went by only one name wore just skimpy briefs."
