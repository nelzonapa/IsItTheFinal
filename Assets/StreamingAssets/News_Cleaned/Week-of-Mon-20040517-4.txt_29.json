    "contenido": "A Chinese chef who was fired from 12 different jobs due to refusing to cook wild animals received a special award from conservationists last week. This is a remarkable story in a country known for its fast-growing economy and capability to send humans to space. However, some skeptics argue that there's a greater chance of sending a human to the moon within that timeframe than protecting the basic rights of animals. The recent withdrawal of historic animal welfare draft legislation, which aimed to provide legally enshrined rules on animal well-being, has sparked controversy. The draft, published online for public consultation but subsequently withdrawn after just four days, included requirements such as specific guidelines for raising animals in captivity, ensuring decent living conditions, methods of transportation, and slaughter procedures. Legal expert Qiao Xinsheng expressed concern that discussing animal rights in China often leads to discussions about money, citing the country's small-scale farming practices and outdated slaughter facilities."
