    "contenido": "More than 1,000 tiger pawprints have been found in a six-day census of the Sunderban marshlands of east India, indicating a slight rise in numbers of the endangered animal, a forestry official said. More than 1,000 impressions of pugmarks (pawprints) have been collected this time, Atanu Raha, chief conservator of the Sunderban Tiger Reserve, told reporters here late Monday. This year's census has indicated an encouraging trend. We have found some prints of young tigers too. It not only indicates stability in the numbers of the big cats, but also indicates that the tiger population is on the rise. At the last count two years ago, 950 pawprints were screened, with wildlife experts concluding that the reserve had about 271 tigers. The Sunderbans is a delta region of the mighty Ganga river, spreading across 52 islands near the Bay of Bengal off the southern tip of India's West Bengal state and neighboring Bangladesh. Lurking in the thick mangrove forests interwined by criss-crossing creeks, the tiger is known to occasionally jump onto boats to pick up humans and then swim through the marshes with its kill."
