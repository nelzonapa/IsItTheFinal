    "contenido": "The long, stringy fingers of hydrilla that intertwine props, gobble up baits, and clog the boat roads, making them virtually impassable, has beat a hasty retreat thanks to the bitterly cold temperatures.\n\nA quick survey of Iatt Lake, a pristine 7,100-acre lake, belies the fact that this lake, located in Grant Parish, has a tremendous grass problem. It's a problem that is slowly turning a fine fishing lake into a giant puddle of water.\n\nWhile there is no visible sight of the alligator weed or hydrilla, the obnoxious weed lies just inches below the surface, out of sight, waiting for spring-like temperatures that will allow it to multiply and spread.\n\n\"It is as bad as I have seen it,\" said Wendell Young, who has a camp on the lake. \"I'm 65 years old and I have been fishing this lake since I got out of the Marine Corps in 1960. I can't recall it ever being worse.\""
