    "contenido": "Besides serving as an excellent excuse for avoiding family gatherings, the vegan lifestyle is about more than just food. Vegans don't \"wear\" animals (wool, fur, leather, down, etc.), and they do their best to avoid using animal products in any form. This is easier said than done. As Howard Lyman, the cattleman-turned-vegan, says: \"To make our choices informed ones, we have to start with the facts.\" \n\nAnimal Ingredients: A to Z provides the facts alongside some philosophical and nutritional context, thus putting to rest the \"where do you get your protein?\" canard. However, its true value and power lie in the 2000-plus ingredient listings—more than even the most seasoned vegan could imagine. While it doesn't require much initiative to learn how to avoid casein, whey, or gelatin, who knew that the dirty little secret behind something called lipase (an enzyme from the stomach and tongue glands of calves, kids, and lambs) was hidden in some vitamin supplements?"
