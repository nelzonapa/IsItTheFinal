    "contenido": "Twin Cities.com\n\nA man named Joseph Donald Leier from Hudson, Wisconsin, has been arrested for brutally stabbing his ex-girlfriend's two cats to death out of jealousy and then leaving one of them on her bed in Rosemount. This is the third time Leier has faced charges related to animal cruelty under Minnesota law since it became a felony in 2001.\n\nOn November 20, 2003, Leier broke into his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Berquist's Rosemount home and stabbed both of her cats to death using a kitchen knife. According to Berquist, her roommate discovered Anika the cat with a knife embedded in its throat while sleeping on Berquist's bed. The roommate immediately alerted the police, who arrived shortly after and found the second cat's body in Berquist's walk-in closet. The roommate's dog remained unharmed during this ordeal.\n\nLeier, aged 29, denies any involvement in these crimes. However, officers noticed cat-like scratches on his arms upon questioning him. Additionally, Leier claimed he was not present in Minnesota on the night of the incident, despite evidence showing he had made phone calls routed through towers in Rosemount.\n\nBerquist, now 33, recalls meeting Leier at a bar two years prior. Their relationship deteriorated significantly a year later due to frequent arguments. Berquist describes their interaction as \"mentally abusive.\"\n\nThis case highlights the serious consequences of domestic violence and the need for stricter penalties against those responsible for such acts."
