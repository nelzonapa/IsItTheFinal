    "contenido": "Most college students lead hectic lives. They balance writing essays in Chinese literature, cramming for an economics exam, working a closing shift at the Olive Garden, and carving out time for a social life.\n\nImagine balancing classes and homework with three part-time jobs, volunteering, and then deciding to start your own nonprofit organization. Meet Lauren Zavrel. Zavrel, a University senior majoring in romance languages, is described by those who know her as bubbly, friendly, smart, and funny. She works for Events Services on campus, the Cash Store, and as a teaching assistant.\n\nBut, her true love is helping animals. She volunteers at Lane County Animal Regulation Authority (LCARA) and spends much of the rest of her time running Puptent Inc., the nonprofit organization that she founded last year. Puptent, which came to life on December 26, 2003, is dedicated to raising money for animal organizations, promoting awareness about animal overpopulation, and preventing cruelty to animals."
