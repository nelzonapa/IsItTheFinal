    "contenido": "Elder abuse and animal cruelty occurred when an anonymous caller reported that a neighbor's daughter threw a dead dog into a trash dumpster on January 20, 2001. The discovery revealed an 90-year-old woman who had been left alone by her daughter for several weeks. The house was covered with trash, dog feces, and mildew, indicating neglect. The animal control officers rescued the remaining dogs and contacted adult protective services, arranging for the woman to be transported to a hospital.\n\nAnimal cruelty or neglect can be a warning sign of elder abuse. This is why The HSUS has partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services' Administration on Aging to raise awareness about the connection between animal cruelty and elder abuse. The campaign aims to address the issue during Older Americans Month, honoring senior citizens.\n\nAccording to the National Elder Abuse Incidence Study, approximately 450,000 elderly people were abused and/or neglected during 1996, rising to more than 550,000 when considering self-neglect cases. Family members were the perpetrators in nine out of ten substantiated incidents of domestic elder abuse and neglect, with adult children being the most common perpetrators (47.3%) followed by spouses (19.3%)."
