    "contenido": "ST. PAUL - An animal rights group wants the city of St. Paul to pursue legal action against a circus company over the death of an acrobat who died during a performance last month.\n\nIn a letter to City Attorney Manuel Cervantes, an executive from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals cites a state law dating back to the 1800s that requires acrobats to perform with a safety net.\n\nLisa Wathne, PETA's captive exotic specialist, called on Cervantes to investigate. The statute mandates a $250 fine if a safety net is not provided. A violation is considered a gross misdemeanor."
