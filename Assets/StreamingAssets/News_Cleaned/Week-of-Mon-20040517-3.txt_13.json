    "contenido": "Three animal-rights activists, including one dressed in a chicken suit, stopped by Capitol Middle School on Thursday to provide the students with a lesson: Don't eat chickens.\n\nBut they mistimed their visit. School let out about noon, two hours earlier than normal. It was also the last day of school for the 2003-2004 school year.\n\nSo the activists from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, or PETA, had to try to persuade a handful of neighborhood children who rode or walked by.\n\nMatt Rice, one of the activists, said the trio had already been to 20 states, handing out literature to students as they left school. They were raising awareness of the \"short, miserable lives of American chickens,\" and the health dangers for the children who eat them."
