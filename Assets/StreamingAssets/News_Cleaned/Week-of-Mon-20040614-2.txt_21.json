    "contenido": "MADISON, Wis. — A 19-year-old Salt Lake City man is on a mission to try shutting down eight primate research centers across the country, including the one operating in Madison. Jeremy Beckham is traveling across the nation trying to educate the public about the cruelty of primate research. Beckham claims that when primates live in steel cages for their entire lives, it causes them to harm themselves. However, researchers disagree, stating that there is no maltreatment of these primates. Experts at the UW Primate Center in Madison say that when people see images of cruelty to animals, it's important to understand the context of the situation."
