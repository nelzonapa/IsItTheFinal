    "contenido": "The University has seen many interesting phenomena in recent years,\nincluding half-naked men with masks peering into windows and irate preachers toting 20-foot signs declaring the damnation of the entire campus.\n\nBut an even more perplexing phenomenon has been the suicidal ideation of the campus squirrels.\n\nThe squirrels' quiet scurrying remains at the Capstone, but the power outages, damaged electrical equipment, and thousands of dollars worth of damage have somehow discontinued this year.\n\nWhy have the squirrels' desperate, life-ending cries for help ceased?\n\nDanny Glover, division operations manager at Alabama Power, said much of the squirrels' salvation is due to the intervention of squirrel guards and rodent blocks, part of the company's reliability effort initiative.\n\nGrant Hiatt, a member of the Alabama Animal Rights Fellowship, said that like the meat industry, it is obvious that animal health and safety is closely related to humans' health and safety.\n\nA perfect example of that principle is the past squirrel problems on campus, he said.\n\n\"Sure, it would be expensive to squirrel guard, but the benefit for de-squirreling [electrical equipment] outweighs the cost,\" he said. \"The squirrels are an integral part of the Quad, and I am sure they have been in recruitment literature. We should do our part and make sure they are not electrocuted.\""
