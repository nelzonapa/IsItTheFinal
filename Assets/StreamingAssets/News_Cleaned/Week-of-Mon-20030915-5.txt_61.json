The monkey will simply do the primate equivalent of putting down her tools -- rejecting the measly cucumber and stopping work -- until she gets equal pay.\n\n\"Wouldn't you resent it, too, if you found that your colleagues at The San Francisco Chronicle were getting more bylines than you, even though they're doing a lot less work to get the credit?\" asked Sarah Brosnan, a graduate researcher at the famed Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta. \"Well, our monkeys feel that way, too, and they act on it to make sure they're treated right,\" she said.\n\nThe findings, published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, shed light on the evolutionary advantages of cooperation among animals in the wild, said Brosnan, because they suggest that such behavior can make a group of monkeys more closely knit and better able to avoid predators.\n\nBrosnan and Frans de Waal, director of the Yerkes center's \"Living Links\" laboratory at Emory University, have completed the first experimental demonstration of fairness and unfairness in nonhuman primates, and they believe they have found excellent analogies to human behavior."
