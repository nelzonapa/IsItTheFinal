    "contenido": "WAUCHULA, Fla. - (KRT) - Out in the woods, the new morning ambles through the oaks and pines, fluttering sunlight over the creek, pestering jaybirds into raucous gargon and wooing the creature from his dreams with fresh fruit, herbal tea and the old, sweet promise: You are safe here.\n\n...\n\nThis center, with its spacious habitats and almost 2, 000 feet of elevated chutes, which extend the animals' range and choice, is one of nine nonprofit great-ape sanctuaries in North America and the only one dedicated to orangutans. It is not a breeding facility. It is not a zoo. Although scientists, animal-care experts, students and supporters often visit, it is not open to the public, and when a convertible full of smiling, sunburned tourists pulls into the driveway, Ragan apologizes but firmly turns the sightseers away."
