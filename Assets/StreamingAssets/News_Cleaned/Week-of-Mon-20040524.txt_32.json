    "contenido": "ASCOUISH businessman is found dead, slumped over the wheel of a rented car near the city of Little Rock in the United States, surrounded by a pool of vomit. Half-a-mile away an electrician stumbles upon a wooden box abandoned beside the highway - containing four of the deadliest snakes in the world...\n\nIt sounds like the opening to a Quentin Tarantino film.\n\nThe trade in selling wild animals and plants is worth billions. Most of that trade is legal, with dealers such as Exotic Reptiles Jungle advertising a range of venomous snakes for less than $100 each, including comparatively less dangerous snakes such as pythons and rattlesnakes.\n\nBut, according to the wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic International, a \"significant portion\" of it is not.\n\nAnd with collectors prepared to pay tens of thousands of pounds for a single deadly snake, and poverty-stricken locals in countries where the creatures are native, desperate to make a living, it is not hard to see why the trade is estimated to be second only to illegal drugs trafficking in terms of profit."
