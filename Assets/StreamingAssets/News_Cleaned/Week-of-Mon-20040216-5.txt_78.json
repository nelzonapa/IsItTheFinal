That is, if you're a goose.\n\nCanada geese in parts of Oregon, including those in Bend, are participating in an experiment aimed at keeping the honking birds from proliferating. In short, many Canada goose populations in Oregon are about to get dosed with birth control.\n\nBeginning last week, officials from Wildlife Services began training Canada geese to eat cracked corn and a bread-like substance from black plastic tubs set out along rivers. Wildlife Services is a predator/pest-control agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nOnce they've got geese comfortable with eating the bait, officials will begin adding nicarbazin, an antibiotic created for chickens. Although the antibiotic was originally intended to protect poultry from bacterial parasites, nicarbazin had the unintended consequence of rendering the birds sterile, according to Dave Williams, state director for Wildlife Services. Essentially, the drug prevents eggs from being fertilized, said Kathy Fagerstone, research program manager for the National Wildlife Research Center, the Fort Collins, Colo.-based lab for Wildlife Services.\n\nFor five years, Fagerstone and her researchers have tested the drug in a controlled environment at the lab."
