    "contenido": "RHINEBECK - How much do you really know about how your food is produced?\n\nIf you're like most people, probably very little. We purchase food from our supermarkets prepackaged and ready to eat, often giving very little thought to where it comes from and what went into making it. That is, until an insider like Howard Lyman gives us the \"plain truth.\"\n\nLyman, also known as the \"Mad Cowboy,\" will speak about his transformation from a cattle rancher to a vegetarian animal crusader at a presentation of the documentary film \"Peaceable Kingdom\" at Upstate Films in Rhinebeck at 1 p.m. on June 19.\n\n...\n\nSponsored by Catskill Animal Sanctuary, the event, which is free and open to the public, is part of CAS's opening weekend. There will also be an open house at the sanctuary, a 75-acre haven for abused farm animals in Saugerties, on Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\n...\n\n\"When he tells you how things are, he knows firsthand,\" said Roberta Schiff, president of the Mid-Hudson Valley Vegetarian Society. \"People should come to learn the truth about factory farming and how food is produced. It is a wonderful opportunity to have [Lyman] in Rhinebeck.\""
