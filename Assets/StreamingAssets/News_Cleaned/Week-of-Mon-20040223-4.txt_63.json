    "contenido": "Ranchi, Wild elephants in Jharkhand will now have their favorite intoxicant placed at their doorstep — to keep them from plundering human habitations in search of the brew! Forest officials in Jharkhand have drawn up a novel plan to keep wild elephants at bay with'mahua,' a local brew that the animals are known to be partial to.\n\nThe elephants are known for their love of'mahua,' prepared from the flowers of a local tree of the same name, and often barge into villages in search of the liquor.\n\nDamage to property is usually extensive during these forays, which often result in the loss of lives.\n\nLast month, elephants raided two villages in Dumka and Godda districts to drink mahua. They trampled four mahua traders to death and consumed their liquor stocks before returning to the forests.\n\nTaking advantage of the animals' weakness for the brew, the Jharkhand forest department has decided to place stocks of mahua near water bodies frequented by elephants.\n\nThis, the foresters hope, will help contain the elephants within forests.\n\n\"We have identified 50 water bodies where elephants generally drink water.\"\n\nMahua will be kept near these water bodies to ensure that they do not venture into villages in search of the drink,\" a forest official told IANS.\n\nAccording to officials, elephants also enter villages to raid granaries."
