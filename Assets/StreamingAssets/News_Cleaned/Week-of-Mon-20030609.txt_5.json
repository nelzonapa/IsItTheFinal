    "contenido": "Research funded by drug companies is more likely to produce results that favor the sponsor's product, reveals a new study.\n\nResearchers analyzed 30 previous reports examining pharmaceutical industry-backed research and found the conclusions of such research were four times more likely to be positive than research backed by other sponsors. \"What we found was that in almost all cases there was a bias—a rather heavy bias—in favor [of a drug] when the study was industry-funded,\" study leader Joel Lexchin told New Scientist. The main reasons for this, say the team, may be that positive studies are more likely to be published than negative ones. Also, inappropriate comparison drugs may be used in these trials, skewing findings in favor of the tested product. The new analysis is published in a special issue of the British Medical Journal, which focuses on the close relationship between doctors and the pharmaceutical industry."
