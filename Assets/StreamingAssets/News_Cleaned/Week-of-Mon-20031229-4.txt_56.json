    "contenido": "About 25 Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep listened to their bellies rather than their brains on Wednesday and were lured to a meal of hay and mashed apples, hand-delivered by state wildlife officers.\n\nFor one of the sheep, it would be a fatal mistake.\n\nThe sheep mowed down the goodies that were laid out in a flat spot tucked in a little canyon off the Fryingpan River about five miles from Basalt. Red cliffs soared hundreds of feet above the feeding grounds. The entire landscape was covered with a thick blanket of snow.\n\nThe mix of rams, lambs, and ewes that came to the Colorado Division of Wildlife's party were oblivious to the net hovering over their heads.\n\nOne second it was the picture of tranquility. The next, all hell broke loose.\n\nWhen a game warden tripped the switch that dropped the net, most of the sheep stayed upright and desperately tried to sprint away from the horde of humans that emerged from behind vehicles and barriers.\n\nMost of the sheep ended up in a massive tangle of hooves, legs, horns, and muzzles. The heads and necks of some struggling animals were twisted at awkward angles. The scene looked like a mosh pit at a punk-rock concert, or a peculiar game of Twister."
