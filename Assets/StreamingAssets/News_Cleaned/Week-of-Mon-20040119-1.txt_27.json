    "contenido": "Vet Emma Milne, star of the hit TV series 'Vets in Practice', has returned to Egypt with the Brooke Hospital for Animals to raise awareness about the plight of donkeys working in the brick kilns of Cairo.\n\nEmma was initially alerted to the suffering of thousands of donkeys by visiting the brick kiln sites with the Brooke last year. Following this experience, a subsequent article in the People newspaper raised approximately £20,000, enabling the Brooke to purchase a new'mobile team' (vehicle plus veterinarians) to reach even more 'brick kiln donkeys'.\n\nDonkeys frequently work 12-hour days in temperatures up to 50°C, pulling heavy loads of bricks on carts between the brick-making machines and furnaces. Most suffer from heat exhaustion, pressure sores, lameness, malnutrition, and broken bones. The workers themselves are extremely poor and work under harsh conditions; they often beat the donkeys to ensure they work as hard as possible.\n\nPrior to the Brooke's intervention, the average lifespan of these animals was very short, and many were worked to death."
