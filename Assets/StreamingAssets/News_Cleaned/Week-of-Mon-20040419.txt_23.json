    "contenido": "The Boston Globe's Sunday Magazine section (April 18, 2004) featured a front-page story about the bone-breaking experiment on six dogs at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine (TUSVM). The experiment ended in all six dogs being killed, one due to complications of infection. The experiment was opposed by students in Tufts' Animals and Public Policy program, as well as veterinary students who later withdrew their involvement because of the program's decision to expose the research to the public.\n\nNEAVS supported the students throughout, including their efforts to work internally and, when those failed, supported their courageous whistle-blowing.\n\nYou can read the article \"When Should Animals Die in the Name of Science\" by visiting <http://www.boston.com/news/globe/magazine/>.\n\nAuthor Douglas Starr did justice to raising the debate, even within the limitations of the article's length. Although he left some questions unanswered, he raised the important questions. Boston is a hub of pro-research sentiment and activity. For the Globe to feature this story was a breakthrough.\n\nAlthough NEAVS applauds Tufts for its past innovative programs in veterinary education, none of us can sit back and allow animal research such as this painful and unnecessary bone-breaking experiment to become their status quo. NEAVS will continue to dialogue with Tufts and to exert public pressure to enhance policy changes which will guarantee that this kind of research ends once and for all.\n\nNEAVS, the Tufts' students, and the general public have drafted a list of recommendations that will be presented to Tufts. These recommendations encourage Tufts to:\n\n1. Become a model for appropriate \"alternatives searches,\" which would have obviated the need for the bone-breaking experiment, as well as its lethal end-point;\n2. Adopt a stricter model conflict-of-interest policy, which would eliminate all doubt that a given protocol and its approval might favor the economic interest of researchers who hold patents on a device being tested;\n3. Establish a policy by which students' input is not only accepted but encouraged and used to expose remnants of old thinking and change practices that have justified the experimental use of animals for education and research;\n4. Ask that instead of fostering Tufts' students' involvement in animal research—many of the new programs the Dean recently announced will do—the university foster its students' skills and interest in developing and using alternatives to animal research."
