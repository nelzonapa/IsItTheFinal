    "contenido": "Though much of big science has centered on breakthroughs in biotechnology, nanotechnology and more esoteric questions like the age of our universe, a quieter story has been unfolding behind the scenes in laboratories around the world — one whose effect on human perception and our understanding of life is likely to be profound.\n\nWhat these researchers are finding is that many of our fellow creatures are more like us than we had ever imagined. They feel pain, suffer, and experience stress, affection, excitement, and even love — and these findings are changing how we view animals.\n\nStrangely enough, some of the research sponsors are fast-food purveyors, such as McDonald’s, Burger King, and KFC. Pressured by animal rights activists and by growing public support for the humane treatment of animals, these companies have financed research into, among other things, the emotional, mental, and behavioral states of our fellow creatures.\n\nStudies on pigs’ social behavior funded by McDonald’s at Purdue University have found that they crave affection and are easily depressed if isolated or denied playtime with each other. The lack of mental and physical stimuli can result in deterioration of health.\n\nSo what does all of this portend for the way we treat our fellow creatures? And for the thousands of animals subjected each year to painful laboratory experiments? Or the millions of domestic animals raised under the most inhumane conditions and destined for slaughter and human consumption? Should we discourage the sale and purchase of fur coats? What about fox hunting in the English countryside, bull fighting in Spain? Should wild lions be caged in zoos?\n\nSuch questions are being raised. Harvard and 25 other U.S. law schools have introduced law courses on animal rights, and an increasing number of animal rights lawsuits are being filed. Germany recently became the first nation to guarantee animal rights in its constitution."
