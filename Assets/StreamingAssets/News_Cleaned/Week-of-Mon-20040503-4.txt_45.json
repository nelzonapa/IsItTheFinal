    "contenido": "Everyone talks about how much hunting and fishing mean to Colorado's economy, and a recent study commissioned by the Colorado Division of Wildlife shows just how valuable outdoor recreation is to the state.\n\nThe report, titled \"Economic Impacts of Hunting, Fishing and Wildlife Watching in Colorado,\" says hunting and fishing together contributed an estimated $1.5 billion to the state's economy in 2002.\n\nThis includes $800 million in direct spending and $700 million in indirect or secondary spending.\n\nOf that, fishing contributed $460 million in direct revenues, including $308 million spent by residents and $151 million spent by out-of-state visitors.\n\nHunters spent $340 million, and combined, the two activities supported more than 22,000 jobs around the state.\n\n\"This report supports what the DOW has known for years,\" said Linda Sikorowski of the division's policy and regulations section, who helped oversee the data gathered for the research. \"Wildlife-related activities are important contributors to Colorado's economy and remain among the most-popular pastimes statewide for residents and visitors.\"\n\nThe report also said big-game hunters collectively spent more than 1.42 million activity days (a day or any portion thereof spent hunting) afield in 2002 while small-game hunters spent 672,000 days hunting."
