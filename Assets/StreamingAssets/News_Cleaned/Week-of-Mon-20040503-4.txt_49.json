The activists claimed puppy mills produce unhealthy animals that often have genetic defects due to inbreeding.\n\nThe Boynton Beach store was sued in 2003 for misrepresenting the quality of the puppies it sold.\n\nPuppy Palace's owner denies that it buys from puppy mills.\n\nCarey Siriani of West Palm Beach owns a border collie, Mia, which came from Puppy Palace two years ago. On Saturday, Mia was wearing a placard that read \"Survivor.\" Mia was neurotic and had terrible allergies, Siriani said, and has required thousands of dollars worth of medical treatment.\n\n\"We're not a bunch of freaks. We're just trying to educate people,\" she said. \"They're going to get big problems in their wallets and a huge heartbreak for their kids.\""
