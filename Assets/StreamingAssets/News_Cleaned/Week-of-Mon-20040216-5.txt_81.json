    "contenido": "PROPOSAL: GROUP AI\n\nAlaskans have been crashing cars and trucks into moose about five or six times per day since the start of the year.\n\nThe carnage includes a tragedy near Mile 105 of the Parks Highway on Jan. 5. John J. High of Trapper Creek died after his Subaru Legacy smashed into a moose with hardly enough time to tap the brakes. A family man survived by his wife and two young children, High was driving home from work.\n\nThat same day, drivers near Willow, Sutton, Palmer, Wasilla, Kenai, and Seward also plowed into moose, according to the Alaska State Troopers. These were among more than 230 moose knocked down on rural highways since January 1, about 100 more than the same period last year.\n\nAt least 16 people have been hospitalized or hurt, while hundreds have limped their cars home with dented fenders and shattered glass.\n\nIn Anchorage, where deep snow has driven an estimated 1,000 moose into neighborhoods, parks, and streets, more than 120 moose have been killed since summer. The specter of a huge brown animal lurking at the fringe of headlights continues to be the white-knuckle nightmare of every Alaska driver: 1,000 pounds of meat and bone threatening to bolt across your path.\n\nDriving highways becomes a seasonal moose roulette that annually kills one to three people and injures at least 100 more. Last March, a 13-year-old boy died when a car driven by his mother crashed into a moose dashing across the Glenn Highway near the weigh station.\n\nEven when no one gets hurt, moose collisions cost millions of dollars in property damage and lost time, and leave hundreds of wild animals mangled by the roadside."
