    "contenido": "OPINION — Exposing environmental programs usually brings an attack from the green direction. Their usual tactic is to intimidate and belittle the writer. Greens hate for the general public to know their real agenda — which is to control all property — on land and water.\n\n...\n\nTrent Loos of Faces of Agriculture doesn't let the environmentalists stop him; he says, \"Bring 'em on.\" Loos exposes PETA, Sierra Club, and other environmental organizations and how they affect agriculture. In a recent article by Loos, he speaks about organizations that use Farm Aid money to sue farmers.\n\nFarm Aid's website includes photos and statements from Farm Sanctuary, a group that promotes a vegan and vegetarian lifestyle. Farm Sanctuary put the only two pig farmers in Florida out of business by promoting a law that bans individual animal housing units for sows. They are currently supporting legislation in New Jersey and California to put more family farms out of business, as reported by Loos.\n\nLoos says, \"To top it off, Country Music Television (CMT) recently ran a Farm Aid documentary. Listed in the credits was none other than Voice for Animals, an animal rights group whose main goal is animal liberation.\""
