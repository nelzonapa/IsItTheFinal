    "contenido": "A stranger uses a bow and arrows to kill someone's two Labrador retrievers.\n\nA city amends an ordinance specifically targeting a particular exotic pet to pack its alligator bags and leave town.\n\nA German shepherd is missing for over two months after bolting from the care of a paid dog sitter.\n\nFor most people, these events — all well-publicized in Portland-area media — provoked feelings of outrage, amusement, or sympathy. However, to Portland pet-law attorney Geordie Duckler, they present the opportunity to advance the developing field of pet law.\n\n\"My most famous case is Al the alligator,\" said Duckler, who was quoted in a 2003 New Yorker article titled \"The Last Meow: How Far Would You Go for a Pet?\" He said Beaverton amended an ordinance solely to pursue (his client's) alligator, which wasn't a huge alligator.\n\nWith Americans spending more money than ever on their pets— an estimated $31 billion last year, according to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association Inc.— it's not surprising that pet owners, and lawyers, would come together."
