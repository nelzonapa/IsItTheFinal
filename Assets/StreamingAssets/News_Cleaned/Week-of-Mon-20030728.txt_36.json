    "contenido": "The State Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) determined that botulism caused 70 geese and ducks to die at local retention basins. \"It's avian botulism, which is caused by a bacterium,\" said Jack Kaskey, a DEP spokesman, on Friday. \"It is not a health threat to people.\"\n\nThe determination came from blood samples investigators took from sick birds at the 3 basins near Delsea Drive and Sarah Place. The basins, which are 3 feet deep, are located behind Lilliston Ford and Luther Acres, a senior housing complex.\n\nThe birds' deaths last week prompted concerns and a DEP investigation. Kaskey said conditions in the shallow basins were perfect for fostering increased levels of the bacteria, noting that botulism naturally occurs in bodies of water."
