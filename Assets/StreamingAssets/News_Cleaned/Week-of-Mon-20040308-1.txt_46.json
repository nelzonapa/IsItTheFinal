    "contenido": "A 25-year-old man, Joshua Eli Lloyd, of Glenwood Springs, was arrested by Colorado Division of Wildlife officials in Glenwood Canyon around 10 p.m. Sunday after he allegedly tried to recover the partially concealed head of his kill from a culvert north of Interstate 70, near the DOW area. The head was discovered by a fisherman Sunday just north of Interstate 70 in the Grizzly Creek area.\n\nAccording to Pat Tucker, the DOW wildlife manager, the head was cut off at the neck and stuffed in a plastic bag. Tucker stated that the body was later found on the hill.\n\nLloyd was arrested on three charges: a felony charge of willful destruction of wildlife; a charge of illegal possession of wildlife, which carries fines ranging from $1,000-$100,000; and a charge of violating Colorado's Samson Law. Under the state's Samson Law, illegal killing of trophy-size wildlife carries a $25,000 surcharge. Wildlife biologists confirmed that the ram Lloyd is suspected of killing was 81/2 years old, with a three-quarter horn curl. Any ram with a half curl, where the horn has grown at least through half or 180 degrees of a circle, meets the Samson classification.\n\nLloyd is suspected of shooting the bighorn out of hunting season, without an appropriate license and in an area where bighorn hunting is never allowed."
