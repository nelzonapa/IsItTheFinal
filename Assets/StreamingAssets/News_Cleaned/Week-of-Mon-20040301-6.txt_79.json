    "contenido": "A mosque stands against the backdrop of oil towers placed in the Caspian Sea in Baku, Azerbaijan. A five-year-old cooperative project to clean up the Caspian has made partners out of feisty competitors Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan.\n\nLast month, Iran, Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan declared war... on the jellyfish. A particularly voracious species known as Mnemiopsis is munching happily on phytoplankton in the Caspian Sea, the building block for the sea's valuable fish stocks. As a result, they're wiping out sturgeon and every other type of fish.\n\nNone of the five nations want to see a repeat of what happened a few years ago in the Black Sea, where the Mnemiopsis biomass grew larger than the world's entire commercial fish catch.\n\nSo the Caspian countries, spurred by their common jellyfish enemy, are coordinating under the umbrella of the Caspian Environment Program. A five-year-old cooperative project to clean up the Caspian, the CEP has made significant progress, as well as willing partners out of feisty competitors.\n\nEnvironmental problems that cross borders have often raised tensions between nations. But a new generation of scholars and activists sees in these problems an opportunity to bring nations closer together.\n\nFrom disputed territory between Peru and Ecuador to the China-Vietnam border, hotspots that could trigger war instead show potential to bring peace. Big political challenges persist, of course. But advocates point to a growing body of evidence that shows that working together to save the environment can begin to make peaceful neighbors of once-bickering nations."
