    "contenido": "Thanks to successful breeding experiments at the Krabi Coastal Aquaculture Centre, seven species of anemone fish once on the verge of extinction are returning to the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. Finding Nemo may have left local theaters, but in the southern sea, a legion of brightly-colored anemone fish, or clown anemones, only recently arrived. For more than a decade, the population of anemone fish in the ocean has been shrinking. Thanks to their cuteness, the fish make for popular pets and thus they are often harvested from the sea to be sold at fish markets.\n\nThese little Nemos are quite vulnerable to environmental changes, though. Many suffer from the lengthy transportation times, becoming weak and plagued by disease on their way to the market. Most die a few days after being kept in a fish tank."
