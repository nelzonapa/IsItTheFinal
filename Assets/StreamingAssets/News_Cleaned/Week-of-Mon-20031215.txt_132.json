    "contenido": "A Dec. 9 story in the Main News section about a Web log written by animal-rights activist Virgil Butler contained several errors. The article, from the Los Angeles Times, said Butler took part in the U.S. invasion of Panama, where he recalled killing enemy soldiers, but the Army has no record of his service. The article stated that Butler shot a man to death in the parking lot of a bar and went to prison for manslaughter. In fact, he was convicted of felony burglary, and the shooting could not be confirmed. The article said Butler killed 80, 000 birds a shift at a Tyson poultry plant. He did not slaughter every chicken personally but was part of a nine-person team.\n\nIn his blog, Butler also claims he saw his co-workers at a Tyson plant in Grannis rip the heads off live chickens, stomp them to death, and blow them up with dry-ice bombs."
