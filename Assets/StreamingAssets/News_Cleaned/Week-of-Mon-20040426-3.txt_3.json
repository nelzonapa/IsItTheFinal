    "contenido": "For so many of us meat-loving Americans, nothing gets our blood boiling quite like the antics of the infamous extremist animal rights group, PETA.\n\nMost of us know PETA as People for Ethical Treatment of Animals. Interestingly, I came across another organization while searching online that also used this same acronym to describe their coalition: People Eating Tasty Animals. Their Web site defined themselves as a \"A resource for those who enjoy eating meat, wearing fur and leather, hunting, and the fruits of scientific research.\"\n\nSo why was I researching PETA online, you may ask? Well, every once in a while, these extremists make a headline with their latest campaign that piques my interest in the same way it's piqued when I smell a funny odor in my environment and wonder where it comes from. I suppose that's what PETA wants — just to stir things up, make people a bit uncomfortable and see how many headlines they can make in the process.\n\n...\n\nAnd here is my solemn vow: once they convince the lions, snakes, and bugs to accept the PETA way of life, I too will take up the PETA flag.\n\nSo go ahead, PETA, witness to the carnivorous beasts of the world, so that they may see the light. But you may want to soften your message first, it will make it easier for Simba to digest."
