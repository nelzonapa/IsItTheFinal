    "contenido": "Alfredo Kuba stands in the kitchen of his Mountain View, CA home, stirring a spatula through a potful of lentils and tofu. Mussi, his sleek tabby cat, watches expectantly from his kitty bed, eagerly flicking his tail back and forth. Kuba spoons the stew into a bowl — and sets it on the floor. It’s Mussi’s dinner. “It took him a little while to get used to this, but now he loves it,” says Kuba. “For a special treat, I give him a little tofurkey.”\n\nMussi eats this way every day, and he’s not alone in his peculiar tastes. Some cats will dig through trash only for empty tuna cans, but others will lust for spinach, steal cantaloupe—even slurp spaghetti. Mussi is a vegan cat, part of a growing group of cats whose owners, vegans themselves, have decided to wean their cats off their “natural” food and put them on a plant-based diet. With the proper supplements, these cat-owners claim, a cat can live a healthy, normal, even happy life eating vegetables.\n\nVegan Cats?\n\nThe mainstream has yet to embrace the idea of vegan cat food. “I don’t know about that stuff,” says one Berkeley pet store employee when I asked about vegan cat food, “Some places have vegan dog food, but I don’t know about that either. Dogs evolved from wolves and I can’t imagine a wolf that would prefer a salad to a moose.” But despite conventional wisdom, some dogs do prefer the salad. As any dog owner knows, dogs love to munch down on meat, vegetables, old pizza crusts and just about anything else they might find in the trash. Most experts agree that dogs are omnivores that can thrive without meat; vegan dog foods can even be found in some mainstream grocery stores.\n\nBut cats are a different story. Unlike dogs, cats are obligate carnivores—meaning that in the wild they would eat nothing but meat. Dogs can enjoy a meatless diet because they can synthesize some necessary nutrients that cats need to get from their food. Those essential nutrients include taurine, arachidonic acid, and vitamin A—all abundant in meat. Cats go blind and deaf without taurine. Without arachidonic acid, they suffer from reproductive problems. And a vitamin A deficiency will stunt their growth and bone formation."
