    "contenido": "Janet Burkley spoke about the events of June 18 and cried.\n\nBurkley is the director of shelter affairs for the Humane Society of Searcy, and she and the shelter are experiencing a problem: illegally dumped animals are overwhelming the already strapped facilities.\n\n...\n\nIt is a scene she encounters often, she said, but for 10 days in June the number of dumps at the shelter astounded even her. And the site of those abused puppies that night has left its mark.\n\n\"People don’t know, but it is against the law to dump an animal. It is listed as cruelty to animals and a person can be fined or put in jail,\" she said. \"We are asking everyone that if they know anything about anyone dumping animals at the shelter to call the authorities and let them know. We are determined to stop these people.\"\n\nIn fact, the penalty for a conviction of animal cruelty, a misdemeanor, ranges from a fine of $50-$1000 and/or one year in jail or a period of community service.\n\nThe reason dumping an animal is considered cruel is that it means they can go without food or water and are at risk of being attacked and eaten by wild animals, Burkley said.\n\nBetween June 14-23 nearly two dozen cats and dogs were illegally dumped at the shelter."
