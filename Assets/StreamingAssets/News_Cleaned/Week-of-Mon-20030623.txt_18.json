    "contenido": "Pigs could one day shorten the wait for a transplant. Parkinson's disease was eroding James Finn's ability to move and speak, and none of the usual drugs helped. So when his doctor suggested an experimental procedure, he decided to go for it. On Sept. 24, 1996, he had holes drilled into his skull so that surgeons could implant millions of neurons to replace a chemical his brain was not producing. The transplant came from an unusual source: a pig, reports U.S. News & World Report. Today, Finn's story traces the promise and disappointments of animal-to-human transplantation, a strategy that could one day ease the shortage of replacement organs like hearts and kidneys as well as tissues for treating illnesses like diabetes. Finn himself is convinced that the pig donation helped him: \"It has allowed me to live a much more normal life.\" But Diacrin, the company that sponsored the study, decided to abandon animal-to-human transplants after lackluster results in other patients, joining other companies that fled the xenotransplantation field after a mid-1990s rush of enthusiasm. Now, however, there's a new, if cautious, optimism that animal transplants may yet realize their promise, and do so before the other great hope for replacement tissues, human stem cells. \"We all hope for stem cells,\" says Bernhard Hering at the University of Minnesota."
