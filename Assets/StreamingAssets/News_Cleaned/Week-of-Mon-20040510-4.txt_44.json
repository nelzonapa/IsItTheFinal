    "contenido": "A growing number of British pets are catching deadly diseases while traveling abroad under the \"pets' passports\" scheme introduced four years ago. The School of Tropical Medicine in Liverpool reports that the number of animal diseases picked up during holidays has nearly doubled since 2002.\n\nIn 2002, 17 out of 84 tested dogs contracted leishmaniasis, an incurable disease transmitted by sandflies in Mediterranean countries. Symptoms included weight loss, eye disease, and kidney failure. Other diseases showing significant increases include babesiosis and ehrlichiosis—blood diseases spread by ticks—and heartworm, a parasite carried by mosquitoes.\n\nBrian and Jean Coleman, from Tyneside, were devastated when their beloved West Highland White terrier, Hamie, died after contracting babesiosis during a recent holiday in southwest France. Hamie, who was just 16 months old and had brought immense joy to their lives, suddenly fell ill upon returning home to South Shields. He developed distressing symptoms and was eventually diagnosed with babesiosis and placed on a respirator.\n\n\"I never thought we would lose our little friend in such a terrible way,\" said Brian Coleman, 55, a retired teacher. \"We were shattered by his death.\""
