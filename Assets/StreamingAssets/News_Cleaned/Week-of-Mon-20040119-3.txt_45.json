    "contenido": "Veterinarian says poultry producers and authorities agreed to keep bird flu diagnosis quiet for fear of hurting exports. The outbreak of avian flu resulted from a miscalculation by the government, which decided to cover up the poultry disease epidemic when it was first detected last year, according to a veterinarian. Though not directly involved in the decision-making process, a reliable veterinarian who requested anonymity stated that the government's initial good intentions have turned into a nightmare for the country. He revealed that the National Institute of Animal Health under the Department of Livestock Development identified last year that the mass deaths of poultry occurred due to bird flu, not cholera and bronchitis as the government had claimed. However, after discussions among relevant agencies—farm operators, the department, and government officials—a consensus was reached that in the interest of chicken exports, valued at approximately Bt70 billion annually, the true cause should remain undisclosed. At that time, they agreed that all chickens in affected areas must be killed to control the disease, while the government would compensate farmers."
