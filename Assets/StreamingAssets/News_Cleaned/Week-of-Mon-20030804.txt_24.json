    "contenido": "FYI on the Responsible Pet Owners' Alliance or RPOA in San Antonio:\n\nWhile the animal control facility, I've personally observed, is far from perfect and the city of San Antonio certainly does kill a terrible number of animals, there's probably a good reason why the RPOA has been ousted— the RPOA is a far right-wing breeder group that ardently opposes animal rights and whose motto used to be \"preserving our historical relationship with animals.\"\n\nI run Southern Animal Rescue Association — http://www.sarasanctuary.org — a sanctuary for dogs, cats, and farm animals, and I have personally been the object of vilification by this group's president Mary Beth Duerler who has branded me as a radical animal rights activist.\n\nI once asked the RPOA for help in rescuing and placing over two hundred dogs and cats (purebred of course) from a wretched puppy mill situation near San Antonio, they declined and ultimately supported the puppy mill owner.\n\nSARA is opposed to breeding animals and we promote veganism and for those reasons we are considered a threat to the RPOA and to hear them tell it all, society at large!\n\nThe RPOA supports and indeed extolls breeding of dogs and cats as well as \"boutique pets\" like sugar gliders, hedgehogs, reptiles, ferrets, etc. They support rodeos and they think that the endangered species list should be done away with— among other things.\n\nI'm certain Animal Defense League and the San Antonio SPCA will do a much better job at placing these animals than a bunch of breeders who go to the pound to scrounge for those \"purebred\" dogs and cats while allowing the others to be killed. The ADL and the SPCA help all dogs and cats regardless of a ridiculous pedigree."
