But it could come in handy if she ever gets caught in a house fire.\n\nOn Wednesday, Maddie came to Fire-Rescue Station 28 on Stirling Road to model one of the special oxygen masks recently purchased by the Broward Sheriff's Office to give assistance to animals suffering from smoke inhalation and other life-threatening injuries.\n\nThe masks were purchased with a grant from Animal Rights Foundation of Florida, a nonprofit organization based in Fort Lauderdale. The office bought 28 masks, which cost about $60 each, with the grant. The masks come in three sizes -- small, medium, and large."
