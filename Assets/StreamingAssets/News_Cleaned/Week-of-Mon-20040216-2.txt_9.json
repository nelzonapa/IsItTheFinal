    "contenido": "Team 4 investigative reporter Jim Parsons delivered the following report on Tuesday on Channel 4 Action News at 5 p.m.\n\nWestern Pennsylvania consistently ranks poorly in national obesity studies. And we all know that obesity starts in childhood.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture says 80 percent of the nation's schools serve lunches that have more fat and saturated fat than is allowed by the government's own limits, so Team 4 tracked down the numbers for fat content in local school lunches.\n...\nFederal law requires schools to keep fat content at or below 30 percent of total calories. Saturated fat must be at or below 10 percent of calories. But most school districts in Allegheny County fail to meet those requirements, according to the most recent inspections by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.\n...\nThe Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine in Washington, D.C., is a different kind of advocate: a pro-vegetarian group that grades school districts around the nation on the nutritional content of their lunches.\n\nTeam 4 asked PCRM to grade 10 randomly selected school districts in Allegheny County.\n\nKeller: \"They could all be doing better.\"\n\nPCRM looked at menus over a two-week period. They handed out Ds and Fs to all 10 school districts. A major factor in those grades was the districts' failure to pass their latest state fat-limit inspections.\n\nAll 10 districts claimed that they have come into compliance with the fat limits since their last inspection, so PCRM gave the districts the benefit of the doubt and issued a new report card. Instead of Ds and Fs, most of the grades were changed to Bs and Cs."
