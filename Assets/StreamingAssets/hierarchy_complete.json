Starting last month, meat products started appearing on the shelves and in the refrigerated and frozen food cases of the Takoma Park Silver Spring Co-op's store in Takoma Junction. It wasn't an easy decision for the store's management, especially since the store was completely vegetarian -- albeit unofficially -- for the previous 22 years. \"It was a tremendously difficult decision,\" said Bob Atwood, the co-op's general manager, but a decision reached after consulting with members and explaining the economics of the situation. Convenience aside, the move to meat has received mixed reactions from members of the area's vegetarian community. Former co-op member Paul Shapiro of Takoma Park said he has heard complaints from members of Compassion Over Killing, the animal rights and vegetarian advocacy group he founded. Shapiro said he is concerned the co-op never formally polled its members on the specific question of selling meat at the Takoma Park store, although Atwood said the membership vote last year was, in essence, a referendum on selling meat. Shapiro, who withdrew his co-op membership over the question of selling animal products, also questioned some of the meat products sold in the store, saying that he called several of the companies whose products were labeled free-range, and that some of the companies didn't actually offer free-range products. There are some people for whom 'factory farming' [where animals are confined versus roaming freely] is the issue, while others say it's unethical to unnecessarily kill animals. We now have what was an all-vegetarian co-op selling some, but not all, 'factory farm' products.\"",

It has reached voluntary compliance agreements with 139 companies accused of violating the rule. Of those, 124 also paid fines that, so far, total $351,000.\n\nProfessional fund-raisers also are required to register their Indiana telemarketing campaigns with the state. Two years ago, when Attorney General Steve Carter first published the list on his Web site, www.in.gov/attorneygeneral/consumer/charityfundraisers.htm, it contained 350 active campaigns.\n\nThe newest list, effective Jan. 1, contains 331 active campaigns — very nearly the same number. (See chart, Pages 8-9B)\n\n\"Right now, it just narrows down who they can call,\" said Summer Burgin, a spokeswoman for Carter's office.\n\nProfessional telemarketers still have a million Hoosier residential lines they legitimately can call, as well as business phone numbers, which are not part of the no-call program.\n\nAnd those calls can be quite lucrative for the telemarketing firms. Fifty of the current Indiana campaigns guarantee just 1 percent to the charity, with the professional fund-raiser claiming the remainder.\n\nThat's actually better than the 2002 list, on which 100 campaigns promised just 1 percent to the charity.\n\nAlthough state law says the donations split should represent a good faith estimate of the final breakdown, \"some choose to go to the end of the spectrum,\" Burgin said. That's because some professional fund-raisers who register campaigns with the state don't want to be held to a higher number should costs exceed their expectations.\n\nOne current campaign, conducted by professional telemarketer Telefund Inc. on behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an animal rights organization, lists a negative 8 percent share to the nonprofit.\n\nIn other words, Telefund keeps 100 percent of what it raises and PETA pays them an additional 8 percent on top of that.",

These animals are produced by several techniques, including transgene insertion and targeted gene knockout in embryos to generate new lines, but the subsequent crossbreeding and necessary genotyping make these time-consuming strategies. The generation of embryonic stem cell lines from genetically engineered embryos combined with somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is routinely used to produce animal clones with a known genotype from which further stocks can be bred and has been used with success in the production of sheep and mice. However, the production of cloned rats has been unsuccessful due to technical difficulties associated with spontaneous oocyte activation that occurs within an hour of egg collection.\n\nIn the September 25 Science, Qi Zhou and colleagues in a collaboration among Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the biotech company genOway report the first successful production of cloned rats using a technique that reversibly blocks meiotic metaphase-anaphase transition in the oocyte and allows the successful uptake of transferred somatic cell nuclei (Science, DOI:10.1126/science.1088313, September 25, 2003). It is a real scientific collaboration between an academic group headed by J. P. Renard and a biotech company team, both providing expertise and technologies. The team reported earlier attempts to develop a rapid, single-step, nuclear transfer technique, but found that within 30 minutes of collection, 70% of oocytes showed evidence of maturation. And while 201 out of 221 apparently successfully cloned embryos divided into two-cell embryos, no fetal development was observed in any of them.",

                        "full_text": "Fossil bones record the history of the human form, but they say little about behavior. A richer source of the way human social behavior evolved may be chimpanzees, with whom people shared a common ancestor as recently as 5 or 6 million years ago. From knowledge of chimp behavior, biologists can plausibly infer the social behavior of the shared human-chimp ancestor, and from that they can reconstruct the evolutionary history of human social behavior.\n\nSuch reconstructions are subject to much uncertainty and debate, especially when they imply a genetic basis of human behaviors like living in communities based on male kinship or conducting lethal campaigns against neighbors. But the goal is to shed light on the full sweep of human social behavior, tracing its evolution from an apelike community with separate male and female hierarchies 5 million years ago to the family-based societies of today.\n\nA principal assumption is that chimps, unlike people, have changed little and so their social behavior is a good guide to that of the common ancestor. One support for this idea is that the earliest fossils on the human side after the split are very chimplike. Another is that the chimps of western and eastern Africa are hard to tell apart, despite 1. 5 million years of separate evolution.\n\nAfter 40 years of arduous study, biologists have put together a coherent, though not yet complete, picture of chimpanzee societies. From observations at several sites in Africa, there is an \"emerging consensus regarding chimpanzee social structure, territory characteristics and intergroup interactions,\" two primatologists, Michael Wilson of the University of Minnesota and Richard Wrangham of Harvard, write in The Annual Review of Anthropology.\n\nChimps are not easy to observe. It can take five years for them to get used to watchers. They must be followed, through hilly country, for 15 hours at a stretch. They can be dangerous. Humphrey, a male chimp at the Gombe National Park in Tanzania, nearly killed Wrangham by hurling a large rock at his head. \"He was just showing off,\" Wrangham says indulgently. A female chimpanzee at Mahale, also in Tanzania, attacked and severely wounded two researchers she considered to be allies of males that had killed her infant.\n\nA major surprise has been that chimps turn out to live in territories whose borders are aggressively defended by roving parties of males. Jane Goodall, who pioneered long-term studies of chimps at Gombe, at first believed she was watching a single peaceful community. But as researchers started to follow animals throughout the day and watch their interaction with others, they found that groups of male chimps went out on border patrols, ready to attack and kill the males of neighboring communities.\n\nThe males in each community are related to one another because they spend their lives where they were born, whereas the females usually migrate to neighboring communities soon after reaching puberty, a practice that avoids inbreeding. This patrilocal system, of a community based on male kin bonding, is unusual, but familiar to anthropologists because it is practiced by most hunter-gatherer societies.\n\nThe males' operational strategy seems to be to defend a territory as large as possible so as to improve the community's food supply, which is principally fruit, and thereby their reproductive success. Anne Pusey of the University of Minnesota has found that the larger the territory, the more likely the community will survive.",

The furry orange ball's arrival at Malaysia's main orangutan center last month, after a plantation owner tipped off staff about her fate, makes her future prospects quite bright. Her kin and other great ape species are not so fortunate. Sepilok has a strong record of rehabilitating its charges to the wild. It sits in Sabah state, the part of orangutan territory probably least likely to be destroyed. But orangutans elsewhere in Borneo and in Sumatra face a grave risk of extinction while their close African cousins gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos are in danger everywhere. Orangutans' main problems are forest fires, illegal logging, and poaching of their babies to supply an illicit pet trade. Habitat loss threatens the other great apes across central and western Africa, which also face being killed for their meat. Adopted as \"flagship species\" by conservationists, along with animals such as rhinos and giant pandas, great apes have assumed the role of high-level envoys in extinction diplomacy. For orangutans, that means symbolising efforts to protect Southeast Asia's rainforests and other habitats, according to Geoffrey Davison, WWF Malaysia's Borneo Program Director. If orangutans are conserved, then other wildlife will be saved alongside them. Such issues feature high on the agenda for a meeting from February 9 to 20 in Kuala Lumpur where government officials from around the world will discuss how to slow global species loss. Beefing up protected areas is one of the priorities of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, the broad aim of which is to achieve a significant drop in the rate of species extinctions by 2010.",

                        "full_text": "Trade\nChinchillas\n     Chinchillas, native to the high Andes, have silky, gray fur, which became very popular in the \nfur trade in the late 19th century.  These rodents were once abundant, and early explorers \nreported seeing hundreds in a single day (Nowak 1991).  Somewhat larger than guinea pigs, \nchinchilla females are heavier than males, weighing up to 800 grams (28 ounces), while males \nweigh about 500 grams (17.5 ounces) (Nowak 1999).  They are long-lived, with records of \nindividuals surviving to be 20 years old and reproducing until the age of 15 (Nowak 1999).  Pelt \nhunting intensified, with exports rising to an estimated 2 million pelts between 1895 and 1900 \n(IUCN 1994).  In 1905 alone, 217,836 pelts were imported into the United States from South \nAmerica (Poland 1892).  These shy animals were relentlessly pursued when they became rare, \nand their skins rose to $200 per pelt; fur buyers gave instructions to agents to obtain pelts \"at any \nprice\" (Allen 1942).  Early in the 20th century, populations of both species--the Long-tailed \n(Chinchilla laniger) and the Short-tailed (Chinchilla brevicaudata) Chinchilla, collapsed.  In 1910, \nan agreement was signed by Andean countries where the two chinchilla species occur, to prohibit\ncapture, trade and export (IUCN 1994).  Once found throughout the Andes in Peru, Chile, Bolivia \nand Argentina, chinchillas remain highly endangered.  A wild chinchilla coat sold for $49,000 in \nJapan in 1981, and others have sold for as much as $100,000 (Nowak 1999).  \n  \n     Wild populations of both species are now listed on CITES Appendix I, banning commercial \ntrade.  The Long-tailed Chinchilla is restricted to the Cordillera de la Costa and the Andean \nslopes of Chile; it has an estimated population of 5,500 in Las Chinchillas National Reserve and \nmay occur outside the reserve (IUCN 1994).  The Short-tailed Chinchilla once had the wider \ndistribution of the two, extending from the mountains of Bolivia and Peru through Chile to \nnorthwestern Argentina, but information indicates that it is extinct in Peru and Argentina and is \nclose to extinction in Chile and Bolivia (Thornback and Jenkins 1982; IUCN 1994).  In fact, there \nare no recent records of the species in Lauca National Park in northern Chile, where it had \npreviously been thought to occur, and Short-tailed Chinchillas have never been recorded in the \nadjoining Sajama National Park in Bolivia (Thornback and Jenkins 1982).  Attempts have been \nmade to introduce chinchillas into the wild, but without success to date (Nowak 1999). \n  \n     As early as 1900, chinchillas were taken into captivity to breed for the fur trade.  The \nInternational Fur Trade Federation estimates that 200,000 chinchilla pelts are produced annually, \nwith the United States breeding the largest number; pelts sell for up to $98 (IUCN 1994).  Japan \nis the major market for this fur, followed by South Korea and China (IUCN 1994).  The \ndomesticated animals have been bred into different sizes and colors; they are larger than the wild\nspecies, with pelt colors ranging from gray and brown to various pastel shades (IUCN 1994).  In \n1994, films of genital electrocution taken on chinchilla farms resulted in a Sonoma Valley, \nCalifornia, farm being charged with cruelty to animals.  Prosecutors documented that, according \nto veterinarians, the animals suffer during this process, in which the chinchilla is held upside \ndown by the tail and electrodes are placed in the ear and in the anal canal or penis; a switch is \nthen pulled to electrocute.  According to guidelines established by the American Veterinary \nMedical Association, such euthanasia should be carried out only on unconscious animals. \n  \n     Since ranched pelts are considered superior to wild ones, fur dealers have stated that no \ndemand exists for wild chinchilla fur, and the government of Chile successfully proposed in 1994 \nthat domesticated chinchillas and their fur not be covered by CITES Appendices.  The \n \n IUCN \n \n \nMammal Red Data Book\n \n  stated, however, that \"hunting of chinchillas still continues,\" and the \n \n \nhighly endangered Short-tailed Chinchilla, whose fur is more valuable than that of the other \nspecies, was avidly pursued (Thornback and Jenkins 1982). This species has not been bred in \ncaptivity, and domestic animals represent hybrids between the two species.  The 2000 IUCN Red\nList of Threatened Species lists the Long-tailed Chinchilla as Vulnerable, and the Short-tailed \nChinchilla as Critically Endangered.\n",
