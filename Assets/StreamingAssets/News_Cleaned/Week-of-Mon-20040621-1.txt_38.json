    "contenido": "MicroIslet, Inc. (Amex: MII) today announced a collaboration with the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) in the area of islet cell transplantation therapies for the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes. Under the terms of the agreement, MicroIslet and the California National Primate Research Center at UC Davis plan to conduct non-human primate studies using MicroIslet's proprietary technologies for the preparation and encapsulation of pig islets. MicroIslet believes that the completion of the studies at UC Davis will set the stage for an Investigational New Drug application (IND), and that the data from these studies will be included as part of the IND for human clinical trials. The project at UC Davis will be conducted in parallel with MicroIslet's ongoing collaboration with Dr. Daniel Salomon of The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California."
