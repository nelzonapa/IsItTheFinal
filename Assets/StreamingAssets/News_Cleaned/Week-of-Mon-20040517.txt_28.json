    "contenido": "Vegetarian cat and dog owners face a difficult decision when it comes to feeding their carnivorous companions: should they choose vegetarian options in concert with their beliefs or opt for red meat in concert with what cats and dogs require? Now there's an answer, and one that's becoming increasingly available.\n\nRuffy is a vegetarian. Bounding circles and chasing her own tail, Ruffy, an 11-year-old medium-sized terrier mix, is also extremely excited about dinnertime. This is currently happening.\n\n\"I usually put some grated carrot on top, but today it's banana—I have to get rid of them before they go bad,\" says her owner, Marian Hailey-Moss, a Manhattan therapist. Ruffy bounds out of the kitchen, turns in a circle, tail wagging, makes a kind of whining, snuffling noise, then bounds back into the kitchen again. \"Sometimes, since she's on a diet, I feed her cottage cheese, oatmeal, and some raw apple.\"\n\nLike Hailey-Moss, more and more pet owners are considering what they feed their companion animals: Some are cooking up homemade chicken, brisket, and lamb cutlets for a finicky Fido. Others, concerned with Kitty's \"spiritual cleanliness,\" or perhaps their own, are buying kosher cat food. And even more are turning their pets onto a vegetarian lifestyle, creating a market that a growing number of companies are springing up to fill."
