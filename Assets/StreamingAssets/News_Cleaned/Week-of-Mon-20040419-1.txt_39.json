    "contenido": "ASPCA Special Investigator Annemarie Lucas hugs goat found neglected in Brooklyn garage yesterday. Another goat was found dead at the property.\n\nA Brooklyn homeowner got the goat of humane officers when he tried to turn his garage into a barnyard, authorities said yesterday. Agents responded to a report of \"two lambs\" at an undisclosed address and discovered a dehydrated goat wandering inside a garage. Joseph Pentangelo, an ASPCA Special Agent, stated that nearby, they found a 4-foot-long crate containing three hens, two pigeons, and the remains of another goat and two more pigeons. They did not know why they had these animals; it was undetermined whether they were kept as food or pets. However, the fact that there were three dead animals present is certainly concerning."
