The public was receptive to the action, though a few hostile people appeared. Basic Facts On the Fur Industry - About 1.1 million animals--raccoons, coyotes, bobcats, lynxes, foxes, beavers, otters, and others-are killed each year for their fur by trappers in Canada. Another 1.1 million animals are raised and killed in extremely cruel conditions on fur \"farms.\" - Trapping weakens wildlife populations by killing healthy animals. - Canada's native people, as well as its wild animals, are victims of the fur industry. - Every year, thousands of dogs, cats, raptors, and other so-called \"trash\" animals (including endangered species like the bald eagle) are crippled or killed by traps.",
