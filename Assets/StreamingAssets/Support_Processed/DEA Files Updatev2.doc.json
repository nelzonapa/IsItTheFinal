Lauderdale, Florida) recently received two \nbooks entitled: \"Mas Platon y Menos Prozac\" (roughly: \"More Support and Less Prozac\"). Both \nbooks contained a rectangular chunk of compressed, brown colored powder (wrapped in clear \nplastic) in a cut-out area of their bindings, suspected heroin (see Photo 1, above). The books \nwere mailed to a Fort Lauderdale address by an express delivery service, and were intercepted \n(and a controlled delivery performed) by the Broward Sheriff's Office. Analysis of the powder (total\nnet mass 99.0 grams) by crystal testing and GC/MS confirmed heroin (quantitation not performed,\nbut the analysis suggested high purity). This is the first time this smuggling technique has been \nencountered by the Crime Laboratory. \n",

The items were originally seized by the \nPeruvian National Police (PNP), and had been in a package intended to be mailed from Lima to \nHawaii. Analysis by PNP chemists indicated that cocaine was present only in the white pieces. \nAfter DEA agents performed a controlled delivery in Hawaii, the evidence was forwarded to the \nSouthwest Laboratory for further analysis. The items had only a faint odor of acetic acid but \ntested positive for cocaine using the nonacidic cobalt thiocyanate reagent. After several \nexperiments, chloroform was determined to be the best solvent for extraction of the cocaine from \nthe matrix. The \"fabric\" became transparent after soaking in chloroform for 18 hours, yielding a \nrubbery material that is suspected to be a silicone caulk type substance (see Photo 2). The \nmaterial was quantitated to be 47 percent cocaine HCl by weight (equal to 370 grams of pure \ncocaine HCl). \n[Editor's Notes: According to the suspect, the Peruvian chemist responsible for preparing the \nmaterial has been in operation for three - four years, has fabricated various other common items \nusing the cocaine-silicone mixture (including wetsuits and suitcase liners), and expects the \nmixture to become a new method for smuggling drugs into the US and Europe. He also indicated \nthat the items are usually mailed, and are also usually sprayed with pepper spray to deter \ncanines. It is worth noting that curing silicone usually has an odor of acetic acid.]\nPhoto 1\nPhoto 2\n* * * * * \nPhoto 4\n",

Flowers, a member of a\nmulti-million dollar cocaine and heroin distribution\nnetwork based in the South-side Chicago neighborhood\nof Englewood, used the wholesome image of infants to\nmask smuggling transports to the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom. Between 1996 and 1999, young female\ncouriers, posing as mothers with babies, smuggled\ncocaine and heroin for the distribution ring. What that\nproved most shocking was that some of the babies used\nin the ruse were rented from their parents and shipped\nabroad as cover for the liquid cocaine and heroin being\nsmuggled in baby formula cans and body cavities. \nIn the roughly 45 trips documented by the government,\n22 babies where utilized as covert cover for drug\nshipments, 12 of whom where actually rented to drug\ncouriers by their own parents in exchange for cash or\ndrugs. Members of the conspiracy decided to smuggle\ncocaine into the United States from Panama by having\nwomen travel with babies carrying baby formula cans\nfilled with liquid cocaine, believing that they would be\nsuccessful because the women would not appear suspicious to U.S. Customs Service officers. \nThe couriers were paid to travel from Chicago to Panama with the rented babies, to pick up the \ncocaine-filled baby formula cans in Panama, and then return to the U.S. with the babies and the \ncocaine, posing as mothers simply carrying food for their babies.\nThe majority of the drugs in this case were distributed in Chicago and New York, while some of \nthe cocaine-filled baby formula cans were exported to the United Kingdom in a designed attempt \nto expand the smuggling scheme to Europe. Utilizing the same ruse, and some of the same \nwomen couriers and babies, cocaine from the organization was distributed to illicit-drug buyers in \nLondon and Birmingham, England.\nClancy Watson Herrera, who is currently in \ncustody in Panama, supplied cocaine and heroin \nto the conspiracy from Panama, and Byron \nWatson, of Montego Bay, Jamaica, supplied \ncocaine and heroin to the conspiracy from \nPanama and Jamaica. Herrera and Orville Wilson,\nof New York, originated the idea of having female \ncouriers traveling with babies smuggle liquid \ncocaine in baby formula cans into the United \nStates. Herrera, Watson and other co-\nconspirators liquefied the cocaine by adding hot \nwater to it and putting it in a blender. They \nremoved the labels from the baby formula cans \nand created a hold in the cans with a hammer and\nnail. They inserted the liquid cocaine in the cans \n \n \n \n \n \nDrug smuggling operative Sylvester Thomas shows\noff weapons and material items gained through the\nexploitation of infants as part of the 'Baby Formula'\ncocaine and heroin smuggling network. Thomas\nreceived a sentence of Life in Prison for his role in\nthe organization.\n \nLiquid cocaine seized during the case in evidence storage\nbottles.\n",

This organization also\nused a variety of illegal schemes to support their\noperation, including the acquisition of fraudulent U.S.\npassports and using bogus airlines tickets utilizing\ntravel agent access to defraud the airline industry of an\nestimated $500,000.00.\nThe successful prosecution of this case was the result\nof an existing DEA case being merged with evidence\nprovided by the vigilant discovery of Customs Inspectors. Combining the DEA case and the \nCustoms case under the umbrella of one investigation was essential in ending this disturbing drug\nsmuggling method and bringing those responsible to justice. \nThe DEA would again like to commend the extensive \ncooperation among local, federal and foreign lawn \nenforcement agencies that participated in the \ninvestigation.

The defendants face mandatory minimum sentences of either five or ten years \nin prison and maximum prison terms of either 40 years or life, and various fines ranging as high \nas four million dollars.
