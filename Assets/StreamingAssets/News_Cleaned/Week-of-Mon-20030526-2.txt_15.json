After this email, I will circulate a sample letter prepared by Animals Asia Foundation to urge the Chinese government to support this very encouraging development on behalf of wildlife, dogs and cats in China. Please circulate far and wide.\n\nI sincerely thank Animals Asia Foundation for their wonderful work for the animals. Please let's try our best to help their work by letting the Chinese government to know what positive effects it will have on the image and financial interests of China to pass this resolution. Action alert will follow soon.\n\nThanks.

Chu Yu-lin, J.P, Legislative Councilor and Deputy of China's National People's Congress, a unanimous resolution was passed concerning the trade and consumption of wild animals, together with domestic dogs and cats.\n\nProposed by the Hong Kong based Animals Asia Foundation, the Resolution stated: \"We call for the Central Government of China to instruct all provinces to emulate the good example in Guangdong, where breeding, trading and consumption of wild animals has now been banned. We urge the Central Government to go further by closing all wild animals markets countrywide, and banning the consumption of wild animals, dogs and cats, together with the breeding and trading of wild animals, dogs and cats for consumption.\"\n\nThe Resolution, which was unanimously supported by the following groups, will now be submitted by Dr. Chu to the National People's Congress in Beijing:\n\n1. Dr. Hon. Chu Yu-lin J.P., Legislative Councilor and Deputy of the National People's Congress\n2. Animals Asia Foundation\n3. The Conservancy Association\n4. Friends of the Earth Hong Kong\n5. Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden\n6. Asian Animal Protection Network\n7. Lamma Animal Protection\n8. The Hong Kong Bird Watching Society\n9. World Wide Fund for Nature Hong Kong\n10. Ocean Park Hong Kong\n11. TRAFFIC East Asia.\n\nDuring the meeting, Jill Robinson MBE, Founder and CEO of Animals Asia, stressed the importance of finding solutions if the country-wide trade in wild animals, together with dogs and cats were to end and pledged Animals Asia's help in creating and producing public education programs nationwide.\n\nDr. David Chu Yu-lin said: \"Eating cats, dogs and wild animals is not only uncivilized, but can also negatively affect our health. The Central Government should therefore ban such uncivilized behavior through legislation.\"\n\nMs Robinson paid tribute to Legislators and officials in Hong Kong and China who were spearheading a new era of humane education in China: \"The leadership of Dr. Chu and government members of the China Wildlife Conservation Association in Beijing is undoubtedly paving the way towards ending decades of misery and disease.\""
