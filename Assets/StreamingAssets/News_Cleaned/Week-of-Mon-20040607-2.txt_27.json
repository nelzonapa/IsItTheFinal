    "contenido": "The China Post Consumers in Taiwan are advised to carefully examine vegetarian products when purchasing them due to the presence of animal ingredients in as high as 70% of these products. Lawmaker Chen Chien-ming of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), stated during a press conference yesterday that 15 out of 21 vegetarian products examined by the Department of Health (DOH) contained animal ingredients such as pork, fish, fowl, and beef products. The samples were purchased from two markets on Hulin Street and Wushing Street in the Sungshan District of Taipei City in early March.\n\nChen emphasized that the DOH should thoroughly investigate all products labeled as vegetarian and impose strict penalties on producers who add animal products to their merchandise. He pointed out that according to statistics provided by the DOH, approximately one out of every ten individuals aged 19-44 identifies themselves as a vegetarian, indicating a vegetarian population exceeding 2 million on the island.\n\nUnder the Food Health Management Law, food producers supplying counterfeit or altered products face fines ranging from NT$40,000 to NT$200,000, while those falsely labeling their products can be fined up to NT$150,000. To protect the rights of vegetarians in Taiwan, Chen urged the DOH to impose stricter penalties. Additionally, he encouraged consumers to pay close attention when making purchases of vegetarian products. Buddhist nun Shi Chao Hui, a professor at Hsuan Chuang University, expressed concern that only two out of twenty-one vendors in the investigation could provide details regarding the origin of their products."
