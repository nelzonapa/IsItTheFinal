Adopting a plant-based diet may be as easy as making a few substitutions.\n\nBefore you know it, tofu dogs, black bean burgers, and sausage made from textured vegetable protein may replace old favorites such as hot dogs, hamburgers, roast beef, and bacon.\n\nSome people choose a vegetarian diet for religious, ethical, or environmental reasons. Others switch to a plant-based diet for health reasons. A vegetarian diet generally contains less total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, and includes more dietary fiber. Vegetarians also have lower rates of some cancers, cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes.\n\nAdopting a healthy vegetarian diet isn't as simple as scraping meat off your plate and eating what's left. Find out what you need to know about a plant-based diet and how you can meet your daily nutritional needs."
