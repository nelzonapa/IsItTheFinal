    "contenido": "When Jeffrey Free Luers and Craig Critter Marshall torched three SUVs at Romania Chevrolet in Eugene, Oregon, in June 2000, they set in motion a new era of monkey-wrenching.\n\nWhile Luers awaited trial, 36 more SUVs burned at the same dealership. Luers' 22-year prison sentence is a reflection of a society that values corporate free enterprise, consumerism, and property above the environment.\n\nThe communiqué following the second Romania fire announced:\n\n\"Gas-guzzling SUVs are at the forefront of this imperialistic culture's caravan toward self-destruction. We can no longer allow the rich to parade around in their armored existence, leaving a wasteland behind in their tire tracks. We must strike out against what destroys us before we all choke on smog.\"\n\nAs many urban drivers replace passenger cars with SUVs, carbon dioxide levels in the air have increased threefold. The Surface Transportation Policy Project (STPP) in August reported that two million tons, or 57% of all air pollutants in Los Angeles, California, come from tailpipe emissions. Whether an oil tanker spill in Karachi or the proposed oil exploration in the caribou breeding grounds of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, America's consumption of 25% of the world's oil is killing the environment and people alike.\n\nWhile SUVs have become a legitimate anti-pollution target, does torching them make a difference?\n\nSince the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) began attacking SUVs, General Motors has alerted its dealers to beware of the eco-saboteurs. Kroll, Inc., a global threat management company, has been advising SUV dealers in security strategies and has recommended that they establish contact with FBI terrorist specialists to share information. All American Pontiac-Buick-GMC in Houston, Texas, hired 24-hour security and installed a $100,000 video surveillance system in response to an incident on September 3, when eco-vandals damaged two-thirds of the SUV inventory. The president of the dealership commented, \"It's definitely going to impact our bottom line.\" Unwilling to accept any responsibility for the nation's growing levels of auto-emission pollution, automakers and dealers are instead practicing a siege mentality by offering up to $100,000 rewards for ELF members."
