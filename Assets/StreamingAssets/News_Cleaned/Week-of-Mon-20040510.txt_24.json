    "contenido": "Each quarter, one article in Healthy Animals focuses on a particular element of ARS animal research. The current issue looks at the National Agricultural Library's Animal Welfare Information Center, which was created in 1986 as a result of Congressional amendments to the 1985 Animal Welfare Act. The NAL website contains links to the latest government publications concerning farm and lab animals, as well as zoo and circus wildlife.\n\nOther research highlighted in this issue includes:\n\n- A test to detect brucellosis-causing bacteria in goat milk.\n- A capsule containing a temperature sensor and transmitter that, when swallowed, measures and sends cow body temperature readings.\n- New swine influenza viruses created by researchers studying the viruses' components in order to develop new vaccines.\n- A commercially available device called the \"4-Poster\" that helps control ticks on deer.\n- Patented selection techniques to find \"good\" bacteria that help protect live chickens."
