    "contenido": "The genetically engineered pet appears to have arrived.\n\nIn a development that is likely to inspire both fascination and alarm, a Texas company said Monday that it will soon start selling a genetically engineered aquarium fish that glows in the dark.\n\nThe GloFish, as it is called, is a zebra fish containing a gene from a sea coral that makes the fish bright red under normal light and fluorescent under ultraviolet light. Zebra fish, about an inch-and-a-half long, are normally silver and black.\n\nThe company selling the fish, Yorktown Technologies, of Austin, calls the fish \"a miracle of science\" and said sales would begin on January 5 through pet stores.\n\nGenetic engineering of animals has until now been performed mainly for scientific research or medical purposes, for instance to make mice that get a certain disease. Making glow-in-the-dark fish extends the technology into the realm of human amusement, which might raise some eyebrows. Indeed, an artist who made a glow-in-the-dark rabbit a few years ago as an artwork attracted criticism for undermining the dignity of life for trivial purposes.\n\nSome environmental groups, led by the Center for Food Safety in Washington, are trying to delay the sale of the fish for another reason, saying it should first be reviewed by federal regulators. The groups say the fish might enter natural waterways if people dump out their aquariums and upset the natural balance in ecosystems."
