    "contenido": "Old men of the sea have all but gone.\n\nA decade-long trawl through the archives has revealed just how fast industrial fishing fleets wipe out large fish.\n\nThe world's fisheries are in a far worse state than anyone thought. Great predatory fish such as sharks, marlins, swordfish, and tunas that once filled the seas are much scarcer today, according to a new assessment. Worse, stocks that are thought to be flourishing may already have been stripped bare without anyone noticing.\n\nMany of the world's important fisheries have already collapsed. The most notorious recent example is the cod fishery in the Atlantic off Newfoundland, where a scientific advisory panel recommended earlier this month that the Canadian government list Newfoundland's cod as an endangered species. Now a decade-long trawl through the archives by marine ecologists has revealed just how fast commercial fishing fleets clear the sea of large fish.\n\nPopulations of these species plummet as soon as big fishing boats arrive, the researchers found (Nature, vol 423, p 280). They fall by about 80 percent within the first 10 or 15 years, but eventually stabilize at around 10 percent of the original numbers."
