    "contenido": "Scientists say lab experiments on monkeys, dogs, and other animals are needed to develop and test new medicines. However, activists argue these tests are cruel and unusual punishment, calling them illegal. They are taking the animal rights debate to the courts and the streets.\n\nIn a 21-minute exposé titled \"Cutting Edge,\" the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection filmed two small marmosets, tree-dwelling South American monkeys with white ear tufts, clinging to each other while looking terrified. Another monkey writhed in pain after surgery, lying on the floor of its cage; others had raw and bloody head wounds that seemed crudely stitched up. The animals appeared in a documentary shot by BUAV in one of Cambridge University's neuroscience research labs. The monkeys' brains had been deliberately damaged in experiments meant to simulate the symptoms of stroke and Parkinson's disease. This important research aimed at saving human lives comes at an obvious cost in animal suffering.\n\nThough vegetarianism is the biggest issue for animal-rights activists, and fur receives much attention due to celebrity involvement and fashion trends, the use of animals in scientific research has gained more public scrutiny. Within the movement, many apply intense pressure to stockholders, suppliers, and other business contacts, and some believe that responding to violence against animals through violence against humans is justified."
