    "contenido": "If you really want to understand mad cow disease, just think of sex and AIDS, the eternity of nuclear waste and playing the lottery.\n\nNow add a hamburger patty to the mix, and grind it all together.\n\nWant to take a bite out of that?\n\nI understand if you don't. So why don't we hear many government or beef-industry officials talking candidly about what's really at play with the discovery of the first case of mad cow disease in the United States? The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is spinning so hard on how mad cow won't touch you, it's clear the agency is more concerned with the beef industry than it is in your well-being.\n\n...\n\nMy wife works for PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and is considered the resident mad cow expert there.\n\nShe's been warning me about mad cow for years.\n\nFortunately, I became a vegetarian when we got married years ago, so I don't have to deal with an \"I told you so.\"\n\n...\n\nThe whole thing is timed perfectly to help you ring in the new year with a real 2004 resolution: Go vegetarian! You haven't heard of mad carrot disease, have you?\n\nWhat cholesterol and heart disease haven't done to push you over the top, perhaps mad cow will.\n\nAt least, get to know your meat with the same precaution you use with a potential sex partner.\n\nEating meat can be just as deadly as sex. And it's definitely more fattening."
