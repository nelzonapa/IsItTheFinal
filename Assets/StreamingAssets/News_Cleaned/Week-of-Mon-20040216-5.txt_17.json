    "contenido": "Marc Langland took a break from his duties as the president of Northrim Bank recently to try on the outfit he'll wear as Lord Trapper. You can see Lord and Lady Trapper in today's parade, which starts at 11:30 a.m. along Fifth and Sixth avenues downtown.\n\nHe's the guy who's got the cushiest job in the Fur Rondy parade and the least of costume quandaries for the Miners and Trappers Ball: Lord Trapper, Marc Langland.\n\n\"I get to wear the big fur coat,\" he said with a laugh. \"It makes it a little easier, particularly if it's going to be cold in the parade.\"\n\nLangland, a longtime Alaskan who's a founder and the top executive of Northrim Bank, once dressed as an animal in a Miners and Trappers entry of yore called \"Cal Worthington and His Dog Spot.\"\n\nThis year, he's on Easy Street with the wolf hat, staff, and ready-made fur parka provided by David Green Furrier. Same with Lady Trapper, Doris Lake.\n\nLangland doesn't know his \"lady\" yet, except from her history and connections, though he did meet her husband, the late Orville Lake. The Lakes are well-known in the mushing community. They have been key players in sled dog racing in Alaska for decades and were charter members of the Alaska Sled Dog Racing Association.\n\nDoris and Orville Lake mushed in the Rondy races, which have been on and off for the past few years because of the weather but are scheduled to take place this year."
