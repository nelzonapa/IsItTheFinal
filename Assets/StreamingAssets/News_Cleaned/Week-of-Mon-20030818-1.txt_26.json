    "contenido": "Fall is the season to see bighorns in Hells Canyon. Out & About\n\nA herd of 18 bighorn sheep wanders along the banks of the Snake River in Hells Canyon, moseying from rock to rock, drinking from the river, and chewing on grass.\n\nFive rams, with massive horns curling over the sides of their heads, are in the herd.\n\nWhat a sight.\n\nA lamb bounds playfully but cautiously between the adult animals.\n\n............\n\nWild sheep disappeared from Hells Canyon by the 1940s as a result of disease, overhunting, and competition with domestic sheep. Idaho was home to about 100,000 bighorn sheep in the early 1800s. There are an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 today.\n\nBighorn numbers started to decline as soon as the state began to be settled. They were easy to hunt and provided food for early miners and settlers. And they were -- and still are -- susceptible to diseases like scabies and pasturella, which are transmitted from domestic sheep.\n\nAs homesteaders brought in more domestic sheep, the bighorns became sick and died.\n\n\"The bottom line is there is no danger to domestic sheep from wild sheep,\" Cassirer says. \"It's only one way.\"\n\nThe main solution now is to keep bighorns and domestic sheep separated."
