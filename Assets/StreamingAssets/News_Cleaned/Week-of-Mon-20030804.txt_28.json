    "contenido": "I'll make this short and as sweet as possible.\n\nOur former RPOA member, Mary Beth, has apparently decided to bow out of the fight against San Antonio animal control and their decision to ban all purebred rescuers on RPOA's list. Maybe I should rephrase that to say former RPOA members, because I think if we don't make a stand here and now, there won't be any more RPOA.\n\nI'm asking all members to plan on showing up on the steps of San Antonio City Hall this coming Thursday, at 11:00 a.m., to participate in a protest demonstration aimed directly at animal control. If a news crew shows up (and I think at least one will), I will act as spokesperson for this demonstration. No one needs to speak on camera if you don't want to.\n\nSo far, I only have a handful of rescuers who've said they'll definitely be there. Does that mean only a handful of people care about the future of purebred dogs in San Antonio? Better think about it.\n\nSo far today, I've received three calls from people who've called ADL and the Humane Society in hopes of turning in their purebred dogs — and all of those people were told \"no\" because both facilities are full and because the Danes are too big. Wonderful."
