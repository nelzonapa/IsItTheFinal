    "contenido": "Every once in a while, officers here at Animal Care and Control run into really sad situations. Last week, they were called to a residence to assist with about 35 cats that lived in a home with a lady who had to go to the hospital. The condition of the cats and the home were typical of an animal hoarder, a person who \"collects\" animals WAY past their ability to care for them. This home was filthy and full of cat feces and trash. The cats were thin, some had genetic deformities, many were deaf and had large areas of patchy or missing fur.\n\nThinking about this disorder, the boss went to the Tufts University website which has lots of enlightening and sobering information. They used the following criteria to define animal hoarding: More than the typical number of companion animals. Inability to provide even minimal standards of nutrition, sanitation, shelter, and veterinary care, with this neglect often resulting in starvation, illness, and death. Denial of the inability to provide this minimum care and the impact of that failure on the animals, the household, and human occupants of the dwelling.\n\nThese cases most often come to light when the \"crazy lady with all the cats\" down the street is brought to the attention of authorities by a neighbor, family member, or health care professional. Sometimes utility workers who notice a foul smell from a residence or garage will contact the police and the truth of what is occurring at the residence comes out.\n\nThe homes are often unlivable to anyone but the individual who resides there. Many of the homes of these people must be condemned once the enforcement case has come to an end because the interior of the home is so damaged by animal waste and filth it cannot be reclaimed. Animal control officers who have to enter the home often have to wear masks or self-contained breathing devices for their own protection."
