Testimonials and photos providing graphic evidence of vicious animal cruelty in Greece are spreading steadily. Cruelty news will, of course, eventually spread via the vast internet, which serves millions of concerned people, and to the international print and TV media.\n\nAs the 2004 Athens Olympic Games loom ahead, the reports of pervasive animal abuse in Greece circulate, and the ensuing global concern will gather momentum. As a result, it will wreak havoc on the expectations and projected financial outcome of the Games. This tragedy could so easily be avoided if the Greek government were truly willing to implement nationwide humane reform. Greek officials disdainfully salute the world with their collective middle finger.\n\nTo date, government action in relation to nationwide vicious cruelty issues is in a perpetual state of inertia and bureaucratic indecision. Legal humane proposals sit idle before Parliament, while the defenseless animals are taking the proverbial bullet for inhumanity. In the meantime, tens of thousands of innocent, unprotected, forgotten, abandoned animals are suffering and dying agonizing deaths through poisoning, hanging, and shooting; as well as by starvation and willful neglect. At the same time, billions of dollars are being spent on preparation for the Olympic Games infrastructure, airport, hotels, a new rail system, hotels, security, and not a single drachma has been spent to alleviate the suffering of sentient beings.\n\nThis is a moral and social outrage. When will this end? The Greek government and her people appear to be keeping this a \"state secret.\""
