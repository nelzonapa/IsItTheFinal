    "contenido": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska – Facing a new Alaska program to hunt wolves from airplanes, the animal-rights group Friends of Animals is trying to revive its successful pressure tactic of a decade ago and persuade vacationers to boycott the state this summer. But tourism officials say this time the plea seems to be falling mostly on deaf ears.\n\nIt seems for once Outsiders don’t care how we do it in Alaska, said Eric Downey, vice president of marketing for Denali Lodges.\n\nThe Darien, Conn.-based Friends of Animals called for the boycott in December to protest Alaska’s aerial wolf control program. Under the program, 180 wolves were to be killed this winter in two areas where residents complain wolves and bears are eating too many moose, leaving them with too few for food. About 140 wolves have been killed under the program that ends April 30. The program will resume next winter."
