    "contenido": "The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals won a battle against the owners of a Ben Wheeler puppy mill Wednesday when a Van Zandt County judge ruled they were guilty of animal cruelty and must relinquish the dogs to the animal rights group.\n\nPrecinct 4 Justice of the Peace Tracey Garner, who presided over the hearing to determine custody of the dogs, ruled that the mill operators will have to give the remaining 30 to 40 canines on their property to the SPCA, which seized 110 of them on January 16.\n\nAll the dogs will remain with the SPCA in Dallas and McKinney until they are put up for adoption.\n\nThe judge also ordered the mill operators to pay the SPCA $6,480 as reimbursement for the money it has cost the organization to provide proper care for the dogs – $10 per day for each animal for six days."
