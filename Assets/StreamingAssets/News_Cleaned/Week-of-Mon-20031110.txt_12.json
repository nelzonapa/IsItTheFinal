    "contenido": "During a nostalgic moment not long ago, I opened a can of beef ravioli, stuffing myself as a kid. I couldn't wait to taste it, to revert, for a moment, to my childhood days. I took a bite and - yuck! - spat it out.\n\nIt was just plain nasty.\n\nI checked out the label, trying to understand why, and saw a list of ingredients that seemed like something out of Dr. Evil's laboratory: monosodium glutamate, caramel coloring, modified corn starch, and enzyme-modified cheese.\n\nSomething sinister happened to our food during the workplace revolution. Food manufacturers started selling convenience foods that resembled real meals. Heat and eat was their mantra. Working moms everywhere started snatching up frozen TV dinners, canned dinners, and \"add water and stir\" meals.\n\nBut it's food that's so overprocessed, much of its original nutrients are gone. In its place are salt and fat—stuff that tastes good but later leaves you feeling lethargic and hungry.\n\nSupermarkets are filled with that stuff. The consumer backlash only went so far.\n\nThe federal government doesn't force food manufacturers to make their foods healthier. They just require labels that tell consumers there is zero nutritional value.\n\nSo those of us looking for healthy food that doesn't contain synthetic additives, unnecessary preservatives, and other chemicals shop at health food supermarkets, such as Whole Foods.\n\nWe buy organic apples because pesticides scare us. We prefer free-range chicken and hormone-free beef—the kind of food our parents used to eat when they were little.\n\nWe read labels. And we depend on the federal government to figure out what's unhealthy and either ban it from the marketplace or require full disclosure on the labels.\n\nIt's a given that we should know what we're ingesting. Right?\n\nWell, that may not be the case with beef, pork, and chicken coming from cloned animals.\n\nThat's right. Cloned animal meat may be coming to a supermarket near you.\n\nThe federal Food and Drug Administration is planning to determine by next spring whether meat from cloned animals should be allowed to be sold for consumption.\n\nLast week, an FDA advisory committee released a report saying that after reviewing numerous studies—mostly of cloned cattle—it found no significant differences between cloned animals and naturally bred ones.\n\nI'm fine with cloning animals in the name of science. But in the wealthiest nation in the world, there's no need to breed animals for us to eat when they can be reproduced naturally.\n\nEven if the FDA decides, after exhaustive studies, that it's okay to sell chicken breast, ham, and pork chops that came from cloned animals, they should require a huge label on the package so those of us who want to bypass it— and I have to believe that includes most of us—can move on to the real thing.\n\nOtherwise, a whole lot of us are going to become vegetarians."
