    "contenido": "A single case of mad cow disease on a dairy farm in the United States last month has sent shockwaves through the nation's $175 billion beef industry. However, as journalist and veterinarian Mark Jermone Walters claims in his book Six Modern Plagues: and how we are causing them, mad cow is just part of a wave of new global infections. Since the Washington state mad cow incident was first reported last month, 36 countries have banned the import of U.S. beef, and a study by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association reports a 15% drop in cattle prices, a significant shock to the U.S. farm economy.\n\nA CNN-Time poll released last week shows that 27% of Americans have either reduced their consumption of beef or stopped eating it altogether....\nAnd so you find this whole range of new infections, from old to new, that is reconfiguring itself. It is mutating, said Mr. Walters. \"There is some reason that this is all happening together. And the reason is that we have made radical changes in the environment and thereby put humans in the way of diseases that evolutionarily did not tend to bother us very much.\"\n\nMr. Walters says in his introduction to the book that the larger story is not simply that humans and other animals are falling victims to new diseases, but that humans and animals are causing these diseases or making them worse."
