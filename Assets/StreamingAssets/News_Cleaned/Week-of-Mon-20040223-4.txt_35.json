    "contenido": "Dust off the dictionary of your choice and browse through its thin pages until you come across the single most important word to all outdoors enthusiasts -- conservation.\n\nDifferent dictionaries, of course, will give it a different interpretation. \"The act of conserving,\" says one. \"The process of protection and restoration,\" claims another.\n\nFor me, conservation is defined every day by a local club, the L.A. Dixon Chapter of the National Wild Turkey Federation. It is named after a man who was a forefather in bringing the importance of the wild turkey to the attention of legislatures and wildlife officials.\n\nBased out of Edgefield, S.C., the NWTF is supported by local and state chapters in providing the resources to protect, conserve and promote game habitat, especially the wild turkey. The L.A. Dixon Chapter represents hunters in Orange County and surrounding areas. It boasts an aggressive membership and actively participates in the community.\n\nOn this Thursday night, the chapter will host its sixth Super Fund Membership Banquet at the Big Barn in Hillsborough."
