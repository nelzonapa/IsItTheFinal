    "contenido": "The Maryland Department of Natural Resources last week accepted an offer of $75, 000 from the Fund for Animals and the Humane Society to mitigate bear and human conflicts. However, the DNR rejected the animal rightsists' stipulation that the proposed bear hunting season in Allegany and Garrett counties be canceled.\n\nLet me clarify: My opinion. Recalling an old Western Maryland fishing buddy, Gene Moon, who said, \"If you sleep with dogs, sooner or later you're going to have fleas.\" Suggesting that the DNR heed Moon's advice.\n\nAgreed, the DNR serves all the people in Maryland, not just hunters, anglers, and trappers. But, folks, if you enter into an unholy alliance with people whose objective is to stop all hunting and fishing, you're no better than they are.\n\nThat's what worries me. I'll wager the well-to-do Fund for Animals and the Humane Society are having parties right now, celebrating their entry into an agency that regulates all hunting and fishing in an American state."
