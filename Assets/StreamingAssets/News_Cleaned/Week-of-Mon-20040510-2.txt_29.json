    "contenido": "Legislation to control violent animal rights extremists will be toughened, the government announced yesterday. The National Association of Pension Funds may offer a reward for information leading to ringleaders being jailed.\n\nLord Sainsbury, the science minister, dismissed calls from the biotechnology industry for a single piece of new legislation to tackle animal extremism. However, he stated that additional provisions to existing public order laws would be introduced shortly.\n\n\"There will be new legislation—though its extent remains undecided,\" he told the Lords. \"The government does not believe in a single piece of legislation due to its potential slowness in implementation. They plan to address specific issues through attached bills.\" Animal research must continue, he emphasized."
