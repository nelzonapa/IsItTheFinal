    "contenido": "The parents of a 25-year-old animal rights activist, Daniel Andreas San Diego, of Schellville in Sonoma County, want him to contact attorney Jim Collins and surrender to federal authorities. Collins is a criminal defense attorney involved in several high-profile cases, including one involving three off-duty San Francisco police officers accused of assaulting two men on Union Street when they refused to hand over a take-home bag of fajitas. An animal rights group called Revolutionary Cells claimed responsibility for the blasts in anonymous e-mails, targeting companies tied to Huntingdon Life Sciences due to their involvement in drug and chemical experiments on animals."
