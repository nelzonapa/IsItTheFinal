    "contenido": "More than 30 years after the first Earth Day, which was propelled by student energy, many of the environmental movement's leaders and activists are aging and graying. Is there fresh blood to carry the fight forward? I interviewed three of Michigan State University's leading environmental activists to find out. Sarah Clement of Marysville just graduated after studying the environment and participating in the Bailey Scholars program. Mike Belligan of St. Johns got his bachelor's degree in resource development and geography a year ago and is now pursuing a master's in geographic information systems. Kristin Konath of St. Clair also just graduated with a bachelor's degree in environmental studies and applications. Each is determined to make an environmental difference.\n\n...\n\nKonath: I try to minimize my ecological impact by trying to be a socially aware and responsible consumer, choosing a vegetarian and mostly organic lifestyle, reducing waste by composting and buying fair trade items."
