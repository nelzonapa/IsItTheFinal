    "contenido": "Type in Beef.com rather than Beef.org and Internet surfers seeking the latest on mad cow disease might think they've entered alternative cyberspace.\n\nThe pro-vegetarian People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals launched its Beef.com Web site Wednesday, happily noting the similarity to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association online address.\n\nThe Denver-based trade group's site at Beef.org promotes the wholesomeness of American beef products and insists the mad cow case reported in Washington state last month is a single, isolated incident.\n\nBut mistakenly type in Beef.com and up pops a picture of a foaming-at-the-mouth cow and the warning, 'It's mad to eat meat.'\n\n...\n\nThe best way to keep your family safe from contaminated meat is to throw any meat in your freezer into the trash can, Friedrich said.\n\nPETA posted its anti-meat and mad cow messages on Beef.com after Michael Fischer of Troy, Mich., allowed the group to use his domain name. Friedrich said Fischer, who was out of the country, was seeking $2.5 million for the address, but offered it to PETA for free for a month because he's sympathetic to the group's cause.\n\n...\n\nIn the United States, it's legal to feed cows' blood to cows as well as sheep and cow parts to pigs and chickens and chickens to one another, Friedrich said.\n\nAll of this is in violation of the World Health Organization's recommendations and of the best science aimed at keeping mad animal diseases out of the meat supply, Friedrich said. Anything with a brain can develop a spongy brain.\n\nPETA illustrates its argument on the Web site with a picture of a gun-toting chicken with the words, 'If the beef doesn't kill you, I will.'"
