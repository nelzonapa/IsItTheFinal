    "contenido": "Norwegian whalers set sail for the Barents Sea on Monday as they kick off this year's hunt for minke whales, defying an international moratorium and angering environmentalists.\n...\nThe Global Anti-Whaling Campaign, an umbrella organization of some 140 international associations, has criticized the Norwegian method of killing whales.\nThe whalers use harpoons tipped with grenades, intended to deliver a fatal nervous shock as they detonate inside a whale's body. Animal rights activists have described the method as \"real torture.\""
