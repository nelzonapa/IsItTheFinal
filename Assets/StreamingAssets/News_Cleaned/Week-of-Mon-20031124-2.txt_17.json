His transporter trailer literally stopped traffic along the Princes Highway, with countless motorists and bystanders taking the opportunity to gawk at the 18-month-old giraffe. Now visitors to Mogo Zoo will be able to enjoy watching the purebred male Rothschild in the open. Ijuma is gradually being acclimatized to the wide-open spaces and will soon be able to roam the African Plain area of Mogo Zoo with the zebra, oryx, and ostrich. Head keeper Phil Whelan, who hand-fed the giraffe during its eight-day voyage from New Zealand, said Ijuma had taken all the changes in his stride. He's been fine, and he has a beautiful temperament; if he were a horse, you could call him bomb-proof. Mogo Zoo owner Sally Padey said Ijuma was given a clean bill of health from quarantine officers this week, signaling the end of a massive operation to re-house the giraffe in Australia. This has been the biggest thing we've ever done; it has cost us $20,000 plus just to get him here, what with shipping, quarantine fees etc. We really have to say a very big thank-you to the Coachhouse Resort for all the help they gave us in bringing him to Mogo Zoo. Over the years, the support that has been shown to us from the businesses in Batemans Bay has been truly amazing. Mrs Padey is smitten with Ijuma's eyes. I think if half the models in the world had eyes and lashes like he has, they would be worth even more squillions. He just has the most beautiful eyes. And she's expecting him to be a huge hit with visitors. A lot of people have been asking about him, and he created so much interest with his trip down here. People have been able to catch glimpses of him in his shed but now he is out on display and we hope to have a female coming for him in the near future."
