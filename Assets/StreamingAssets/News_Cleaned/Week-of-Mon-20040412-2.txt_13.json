Highlighting the evening's activities will be the mega-auction of rare bottles of champagne and exotic species of freshwater fish, some in alluring combinations.\n\n\"Saturday night was invitation-only, Sunday is open to the public,\" reports Arthur Swordane, operations manager of the show for its sponsor, Global Ways importers. \"We pair a Veuve Clicquot Grand Dame Rose with a large Jardini Arowana right off the bat on Sunday... watch for it.\"\n\nSaturday night festivities brought out such notables as socialite Luella Vedric and musician r'Bert, who were special guests of Global Ways owner Madhi Kim. It is said both are looking to add to their current tropical fish collections, as well as their wine cellars."
