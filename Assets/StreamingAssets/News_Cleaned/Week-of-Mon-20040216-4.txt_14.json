    "contenido": "People were urged not to feed them. Living in the woods during a winter when there has been more than 71 inches of snowfall can be uncomfortable. It can be tough. But it doesn't have to be fatal. Even though there has been continuous snow coverage on the ground since the first week of December — sometimes deep snow with an icy crust on the surface — Pennsylvania Game Commission personnel are not reporting significant winter-related mortality among the Commonwealth's wild animals and birds. Wildlife are built to handle these types of winters. They are, for the most part, able to survive. Mel Schake, the game commission's information and education supervisor for southwestern Pennsylvania, said wildlife conservation officers in his region have found a couple of deer that apparently died of broken bones and other injuries sustained in falls on icy hillsides. And Indiana County's wildlife conservation officers reported that four deer died when they fell through the ice covering the Mahoning and Little Mahoning creeks. But game commission personnel are not seeing widespread evidence of animals and birds starving. As tough as it seems, it's not negatively impacting wildlife."
