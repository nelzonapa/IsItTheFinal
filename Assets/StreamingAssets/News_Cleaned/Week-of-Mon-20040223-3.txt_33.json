That report found severe deficiencies at the zoo in animal care, pest control, record-keeping, and management that contributed to the deaths of 23 animals in the past six years. \"I have pushed, pulled, and prodded to move the zoo forward,\" Spelman, 41, said in a news conference announcing her resignation. \"But now, to accelerate the rate of our progress, I have concluded that it is time for me to move on... I have become a lightning rod for too much attention. It has become a distraction for the zoo and the Smithsonian.\"\n\nThe report is a grim catalog of failure: In January, two endangered adult male pandas died after rat-poison pellets that emit toxic fumes were buried in their yard for the first time. Two of the zoo’s four Grevy's zebras died in early 2000 of hypothermia, and necropsies showed the animals had \"no body fat\" to ward off the severe winter weather. In 2002, after being anesthetized for a physical exam to check on a limp, a middle-aged lion was found dead in his cage the next morning from complications related to the anesthesia. Rats are deplorably common at the zoo, infesting the habitats of other animals; zookeepers were found to misplace and even alter records on animal care.\n\nSpelman stated, \"I have become a lightning rod for too much attention. It has become a distraction for the zoo and the Smithsonian.\""
