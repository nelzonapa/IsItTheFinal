In the last twenty years, the number of hunters in the United States has declined, but the amount of money hunters are spending has increased dramatically according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Fund for Animals. One result of these trends is the emergence of \"canned hunts\" in many states across America. The Fund for Animals estimates that since 1980 nearly 2000 hunting preserves have opened, with 500 in Texas alone. These hunts are conducted on private land stocked with exotic animals, such as zebras, antelope, rams, and even the occasional lion. Hunters pay thousands of dollars to spend a few days tracking and killing these animals, and most ranches guarantee hunters will not go home empty handed. To further favor hunters, most canned hunt ranches either fence animals into small areas or train animals to eat from the same spot each day, according to the Fund for Animals' report \"Canned Hunts: Unfair at Any Price\".
