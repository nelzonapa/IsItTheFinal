    "contenido": "The Ruckus Society rethinks the US anti-corporate globalization movement; foregrounds POC leadership, anti-oppression analysis?\n\nIn the sticky heat of a secluded Florida campground, under a large open-air tent, a group of activists closes their eyes. How many saw a white person?\n\nOver a hundred and fifty activists — roughly a third of them people of color — have gathered in the Florida wetlands from across the hemisphere, united in opposition to corporate globalization, to participate in a week-long training camp hosted by the Oakland-based Ruckus Society.\n\nThe better part of a day was devoted to debate between animal rights activists (primarily white) and meat eaters (primarily working class and people of color) after meat was brought into the historically vegetarian and vegan camp space for the first time, at the demands of many people of color.\n\nJohn Taylor, a 25-year-old organizer with the African American Environmental Justice Action Network in Atlanta, was one of them.\n\nIn America, if you have access to resources and wealth, you can make a conscious decision not to eat meat. But if you come from one of my communities, then you eat whatever is given to you, because you don’t have the luxury to say, “I don’t want to eat that.” Taylor, who is learning puppet construction, political theater, dance, and costume design as part of the Arts in Action track, also noted that meat is an important part of many indigenous spiritual traditions."
