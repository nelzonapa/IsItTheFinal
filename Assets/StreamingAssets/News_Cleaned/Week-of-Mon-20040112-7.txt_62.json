    "contenido": "So many strays, so little time. And money. And volunteers. And space. \nMoore County is unusually rich in the number of animal lovers' groups and organizations devoted to helping unwanted animals. \nSome provide shelters and formal adoptions. Others operate out of their homes on a shoestring. And a few consist of cellphone numbers and groups of volunteers who manage to get things done without a shelter. \nThe most recent count shows no fewer than six active groups, ranging from the oldest and best known, Moore Humane Society, to the latest, Sandhills Animal Rescue League Inc. \nA couple of people run small shelters out of their homes - such as Solutions for Animals, just over the county line in Hoke. Others lack shelters but actively raise money and help pay for spayings and neuterings, such as Animal Advocates in Pinehurst. \nThe public is confused as to which group does what, and they are not getting the support they need, says Linda Hubbard of Southern Pines, volunteer coordinator for the Moore County Schools."
