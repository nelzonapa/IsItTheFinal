    "contenido": "The American habit of eating large amounts of meat is a major threat to human health, the environment, small communities, and farmers, according to speakers at recent conferences at the Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHSPH), entitled \"Eating for the Future: Can Public Health Rise to the Challenge?\" Scientists from diverse fields met at JHSPH to discuss whether humans need meat in the quantities they consume in the United States, how their levels of meat consumption affect American health, and whether meat production actually pollutes the environment.\n...\nOn campus, the diet choices for students vary widely. Many students eat a traditional American amount of meat, such as sophomore David Burgess, who says, \"I eat meat at every meal.\" Others do not consider meat essential but eat it frequently, such as sophomore Karen Lopez, who says, \"I don't need to eat meat every day. I do eat meat every day, but it's not a necessity.\"\nIn stark contrast to these views on meat consumption are those of senior Michael Brown, known informally as \"Vegan Mike\" by his friends and acquaintances. Brown summarized his views on meat eating, stating, \"The reason I don't eat meat is because I believe that raising animals in a factory farm environment increases unnecessary suffering. I am also a big fan of the fact that my diet is cholesterol-free.\" Brown, who has been a vegan since his freshman year and a vegetarian since he was 15 years old, added that \"the laws regarding free-range chicken are ridiculously loose,\" when asked about the classification developed to provide consumers with alternatives to factory-farmed livestock. While he supports efforts to reduce the suffering of animals raised for meat, he remains fundamentally opposed to the slaughter of animals for food, saying, \"I don't feel that there is a humane form of killing.\""
