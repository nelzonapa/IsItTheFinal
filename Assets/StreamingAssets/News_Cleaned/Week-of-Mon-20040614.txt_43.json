    "contenido": "The woman known as the \"Dog Lady\" in Liberty County has no more dogs.\n\nAt a hearing Monday, Patsy Boucher, a 58-year-old retired truck driver, was forced to permanently relinquish her 121 dogs; three pigs, three guinea pigs, one cat, seven finches, and a cockatiel that can whistle the theme to The Bridge on the River Kwai.\n\nJustice of the Peace Burl Thomas ordered the animals turned over to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Houston after investigators testified that Boucher's two-room wooden house and half-acre lot about 35 miles north of Houston was unfit for both humans and animals. Precinct 5 Constable L. W. DeSpain said the stench from the urine and feces inside the house and around the yard was so strong that he vomited after entering the property with a warrant to temporarily seize the animals on June 1.\n\nBoucher, who represented herself at Monday's hearing, berated Liberty County for refusing to spend the money needed to provide an animal shelter for the many strays dumped in the county's rural areas.\n\n\"I have done nothing wrong but take stray dogs off the streets with nowhere else to go. I admit to being overwhelmed,\" she said while crying, \"but I have never done anything cruel. I love my dogs. Now they're going to be euthanized.\""
