    "contenido": "Franciscan friars of St. Boniface Church in the Tenderloin reverently offered their annual Blessing of the Animals ceremony on Sunday afternoon, October 4, to dozens of dogs, cats, hamsters, turtles, parakeets, rabbits, and other soulful beasts who graciously received the sacred prayers and the sprinkling of holy water. I saw no serpents here, but I did see four Guardian Angels wearing red berets and camouflage pants, plus mayoral candidate Angela Alioto, who schmoozed with the pastor. Mingles with the masses, I posed a crucial theological question.\n\nExcuse me, are you Father Floyd Lotito? You organized this event? Is today St. Francis of Assisi’s birthday?\n\nYes, I am Father Lotito. Today is St. Francis’ Feast Day. It is actually the day that he died in 1226, but it also symbolizes his “birthday” with joining God in Heaven.\n\nSt. Francis is the patron saint of animals. He saw all creation as part of a family, with animals as his brothers and sisters. There are many stories of his friendships with animals. The Wolf of Gubbio was terrorizing people, for example, but St. Francis made peace with him through dialogue and conversation.\n\nDo pets go to Heaven?\n\nAll creation has been elevated through the incarnation of Jesus, and animals are part of creation."
