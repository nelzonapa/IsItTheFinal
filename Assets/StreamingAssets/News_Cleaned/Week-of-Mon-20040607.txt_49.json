    "contenido": "Below is a list of Ringling's false ad claims from PETA:\n\nAccording to Ringling's latest ad campaign, \"All our newborns come with a \nlifetime guarantee.\" The Ringling ad goes on to claim that its captive-breeding program is somehow helping endangered Asian elephants. Ringling must believe that there is a sucker born every minute because PETA has evidence that the ads are pure fantasy. Government documents show that Ringling's elephants suffer abuse and die prematurely, that the circus has been cited for more than 100 deficiencies in animal care, and that most of its elephants were captured in the wild. PETA is calling on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to yank the bogus ads.\n\nFalse Claim #1: \"All our newborns come with a lifetime guarantee.\"\nReality: Ringling forcibly removes still-nursing baby elephants from their mothers, causing trauma, harm, and even death. This barbaric practice has contributed to the deaths of two baby elephants and to the painful injuries of two others.\n\n?\nRingling paid $20,000 to settle U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) charges of failing to provide veterinary care to a dying baby elephant named Kenny. Kenny was forced to perform despite obvious illness and was found dead in his stall in a pool of bloody diarrhea. \n\nBenjamin drowned while trying to escape the pokes and prods of a handler chasing him with a bullhook. Even though elephants are excellent swimmers, Benjamin had never had the opportunity to learn how to swim from his mother.\n\nWhen taken from their mothers, Doc and Angelica suffered painful injuries as they struggled in terror against ropes tightly binding their legs in a futile attempt to rejoin their mothers. The ropes left raw wounds on their legs.\n\nRingling trumpets the births of \"15 bundles of joy\" at its breeding compound since 1992. In fact, four of the 15 births that Ringling is taking credit for occurred at Busch Gardens, not Ringling's Elephant Conservation Center, and belonged to an elephant trainer named Roman Schmitt."
