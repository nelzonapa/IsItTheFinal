George Hughes, who lives outside Annapolis, Md., has watched bucks use their antlers to lift the cages off his tomatoes and sample the juicy Big Boys. They also mowed down 1,000 junipers he had planted at his tree farm in Easton, Md.\n\nHe had been told deer don't eat junipers. \"Well, they don't like juniper, but if they get a bad enough winter, they'll eat anything,\" he said.\n\nSo he rallied his fellow homeowners in Saefern, a community of 105 homes on 250 acres, to bring the hunters in. He found a group of Vietnam veterans who are ace bowhunters. They killed 15 deer in Saefern last hunting season. \"And they're going to do the same this year,\" Hughes said.\n\nHunting seasons have been extended, and states like Pennsylvania, Maryland, and New Jersey have encouraged hunters to shoot does instead of bucks. But even sharpshooters do not usually enter densely packed neighborhoods to hunt deer. All those fertilized suburban lawns, luscious azaleas, and kitchen gardens packed with sweet corn have bolstered deer populations.\n\nAnimal rights activists, like Nancy Bowman, the president of the Mercer County Deer Alliance, a coalition with 1,500 members, voiced their outrage and filed lawsuits. \"It's morally and ethically bankrupt,\" Bowman said this week. \"And it's not necessary.\" Bowman says that deer are not destroying the habitat.\n\nAnimal rights groups say there are other ways to protect the gardens. \"We suggested relocating the deer and doing a contraception program,\" said Stephanie Boyles, a wildlife biologist for PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. \"Killing the ones inside doesn't solve the problem because more will just move in to take their place.\""
