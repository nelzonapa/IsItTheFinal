    "contenido": "At the eastern edge of the Bitterroot Mountains, a craggy range of peaks that defines the border between Idaho and Montana, is a lab full of skeptics who don't hold with the majority scientific consensus on mad cow disease.\n\nThey are world-class researchers on these kinds of diseases, categorically called \"transmissible spongiform encephalopathies\" -- or TSEs.\n\nSome of these diseases have been recognized for a long time, but they captured wide public attention only when it appeared -- first in Britain -- that the disease could get passed on to people who eat beef from a cow with this type of brain infection, which eats holes in the brain.\n\nAmericans were reminded of this risk recently after the nation's first known case of mad cow disease (technically bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE) was identified just before Christmas in Eastern Washington.\n\nMost of the scientists here at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a branch of the National Institutes of Health, accept that this kind of \"cross-species\" transfer of a TSE can, on rare occasions, take place. They were some of the first to show it, in fact, in experimental animals.\n\nBut try to make any other simple statement of fact about mad cow or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, CJD, and you will encounter a stubborn refusal to let you move even one step beyond the evidence.\n\nWhether it's a prion that's transmitting the infection, Race said, or some other unrecognized virus is still unknown. The confusing terminology in this field fraught with uncertainty, he said, is enough to drive even many scientists nuts."
