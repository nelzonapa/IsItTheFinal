    "contenido": "Most people don't know this, but the National Western Stock Show is also a convention of various species of livestock. During visiting hours, the cattle, sheep, and swine just stand around looking pretty, but in the wee hours of the morning, they assemble to discuss current issues and how they might best respond.\n\nFew people have been privileged to observe these deliberations, but over the years, I've made some good connections — among them, a grumpy old Hereford range bull who smuggled me into the American Bovine Congress in a small building off Washington Street on Sunday night.\n\nAbout two dozen cattle, representing all the well-known breeds and a few that aren't, were present when the chairsteer, a Texas Longhorn whose moo had a twangy drawl, called the meeting to order and explained the agenda: \"First, we have to determine whether there is an outbreak of Mad Human Disease in the United States. Then, if there is, we must decide how to respond to it. So, if anyone has any evidence one way or another, take the floor.\"\n\n...\n\nBut what about PETA? Those crazy humans want to take away that good life of yours. They say you're being abused and tortured.\n\nThe Bucking Bull admitted that it was one of his great pleasures to break a human leg or neck every so often, so he couldn't see how that was abuse. Thus he agreed that PETA could be a symptom of Mad Human Disease.\n\n...\n\nEd Quillen of Salida is a former newspaper editor whose column appears Tuesday and Sunday."
