The Edmonton Human Society, formerly known as the Edmonton Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), and local dog sitter and canine expert Lisa Ecker, owner-operator of Fort Saskatchewan Canine Services, share insights.\n\nDogs, especially those with shorter hair, young ones, and seniors, generally fare better outdoors for longer periods. However, larger, long-haired breeds require insulated or heated doghouses. Straw makes excellent bedding; avoid blankets which can freeze and worsen the situation. Metal water dishes are dangerous; use non-metal materials instead. Salt used on sidewalks can harm pets' feet, so rinse them thoroughly afterward. Keep hair trimmed short to prevent ice balls from irritating toes. For indoor pets without much exposure to cold weather, consider wearing sweaters or jackets. Short-coated dogs may benefit from winter protection too."
