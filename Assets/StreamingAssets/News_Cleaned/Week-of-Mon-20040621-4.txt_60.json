    "contenido": "Carson & Barnes Circus states that a clerical error led to their advertising their 5-year-old baby elephant, \"Jennie,\" in stories sent to area media ahead of its Sunday performances in Willits.\n\nJennie passed away in April.\n...\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) raised concerns about the circus's performance in Willits due to the elephant's death from a herpes virus attributed to the stress of separation from her mother too early and traveling at just 16 months old.\n\nPETA claims that Carson & Barnes recklessly mixes Asian and African elephants, despite African elephants carrying the herpes virus in a dormant state and potentially passing it to nearby endangered Asian elephants, leading to avoidable deaths."
