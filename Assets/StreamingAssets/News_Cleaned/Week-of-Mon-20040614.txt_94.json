Bear beamed. I should be giving out cigars!\n\nBear told this reporter that he was lucky to find some of the species in breeding pairs.\n\nIt's hard to find some of these little guys. For example, the Green Dragonbird is really, really rare!\n\nThe Green Dragonbird is much like a blue peacock, but the tail sports an iridescent greenish hue. Other species added to his collection include New Guinea Singing Dogs, Amur Tigers, Somali Ostriches, Short-tailed Chinchillas, and two Northeast Congo lions.\n\nI've got an in with a local goat farmer, Bear told us, I don't want Pookey, that's the male lion, eating any of my Cuvier's Gazelle.\n\nBear plans to have a week-long open house once the animals are settled."
