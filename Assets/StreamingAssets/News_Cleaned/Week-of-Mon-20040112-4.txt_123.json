    "contenido": "By now, pretty much everyone in the United States has heard of the Holstein from Mabton, Wash., found to be infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), better known as mad cow disease. What people may not know is how this disease that devastated the British beef industry in the 1990s has been allowed to spread to Washington state.\n\nAfter all, don't we have governmental agencies set up to protect our food, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)? Yes, we do have these agencies, but anyone who has wondered what ill-effects the push for less government has gotten us need look no further.\n\n...\n\nPresidential contender Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), who, incidentally, is a vegetarian, has devoted a web page to mad cow disease which states, \"Last year, the USDA tested only 19, 990 cattle believed to be at risk for mad cow disease, out of a population of about 96 million or 1 out of every 5, 000 cattle. By contrast, in Europe every single animal above a given age gets tested for this fatal brain-wasting disease (one out of every four cattle).?\"\n\nKucinich proposes seven new steps to help make meat safer: Prohibit meat from downer cattle from entering the human food supply; test all downer cattle (estimates range from 190, 000 to 970, 000 animals) using modern rapid quick tests; establish a mandatory trace-back system for all bovines; require mandatory recall of food products infected; prohibit the feeding of the remains of any mammal to any animals that humans eat; tighten the law on dietary supplements, which currently allows supplements to contain central nervous system tissue; and require doctors and hospitals to report all cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob (mad cow) to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAll of these measures would enhance public health but would also cut into the meatpacking industry's fat corporate profits. Hence the resistance."
