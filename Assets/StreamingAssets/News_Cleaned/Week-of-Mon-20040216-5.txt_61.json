    "contenido": "What's worse: injecting a fatal dose of sodium pentobarbital into a healthy German shepherd or watching him walk in tiny circles as he comes unhinged in a kennel where the din of barking never lets up?\n\nKathy Eller, Animal Friends humane education coordinator, takes a break from work to give a treat to Pokey, a 2-year-old hound mix who has been at the Strip District shelter since June 2003. Longer-term dogs get a visit to the offices.\n\nThough it doesn't often come down to that in the work of caring for abandoned or unwanted animals, the stark choice of quick death or troubled life is at the crux of an argument between the growing \"no-kill\" movement and traditional humane society policies that include euthanasia.\n\nNo-kill proponents, who aim to save all homeless companion animals, say that euthanizing creatures that are not critically ill is cruel and unnecessary, and that successful programs around the country show their approach can work. Opponents say that goal is laudable, but that in practice, many no-kill shelters turn away the worst-case animals, which still have to be dealt with by someone, and that sometimes no-kill shelters end up warehousing animals in circumstances that are worse than death."
