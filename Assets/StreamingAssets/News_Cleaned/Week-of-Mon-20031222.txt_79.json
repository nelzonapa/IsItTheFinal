    "contenido": "Thanks to all of your kind hearts, we have taken over half of the piggy angels off the tree. With a few days yet to go, we hope they will all be chosen! What lucky piggies to have such friends.\n\nWith snow on the ground and the thermometer sitting at 20 degrees this morning, I am glad that everyone here has a warm bed. With so much hay, they can lose themselves in it. We put out about 30 bales last weekend and yesterday I put out another 40.\n\nIf you know of any pigs who do not have a suitable house or bedding, please email us. We will try to get some help to them. There are several organizations now doing the Helping Hoof program, so when you see pigs in need, email me and I will pass it along to Tammy or Lana or whoever might be closest. And any sanctuary will help a pig in need—it doesn’t have to have a formal program. What we couldn’t dream of doing alone, together we make happen every day... just for the love of pigs. And all of you who are part of the Helping Hoof program are the reason it works—may you find a special joy in your heart this Christmas, knowing that some pig somewhere is safe because of your caring."
