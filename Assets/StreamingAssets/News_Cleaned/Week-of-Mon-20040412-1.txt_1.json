    "contenido": "Visitors to the Carson & Barnes 5-Ring Circus got an unexpected sight at the gate Monday night: a woman pretending to use a bullhook to beat her daughter, who was dressed up as a circus elephant. Three other women held protest signs.\n\nChristina Dryden, a Clovis resident and organizer of the protest, stated, \"Until animal acts are out of circuses, the violence will not stop.\" She added, \"Any circus that has animal acts presents animal cruelty. The animals are held captive, forced to perform shows. That is not what elephants are supposed to be doing.\"\n\nRiene Wyatt, the mother holding the bullhook, objected to the training methods used in circuses. \"The means they use to train these animals are horrific,\" she said. \"Bullhooks, blowtorches, and worse.\"\n\nThe circus held two shows in Clovis on Monday night. The circus will also have shows in Las Vegas, New Mexico, tonight.\n\nJoe Frisco III, a third-generation elephant trainer with the circus, stated, \"The protesters don't know what they're talking about because they haven't worked with the animals. You're not going to get a 10,000-pound animal to do anything it doesn't want to do. Animals at this circus come first. In the wild, every day they are hunted for their trunks, killed because the population is too big and there's no room for them.\"\n\nDryden, who is a member of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said they received a mixed reaction from circus patrons when passing out literature to those entering the gates."
