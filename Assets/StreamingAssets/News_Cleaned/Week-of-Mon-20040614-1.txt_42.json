    "contenido": "Please don’t ask me why I am a vegetarian. Seriously, don’t ask. I’ll give you the most obvious response: I don’t like meat. To that, you’re going to (quizzically) ask me “why?”?\n\nSee, if I tell you it’s for animal rights, then you’re going to point out my leather shoes and the fact that I’m eating Skittles (gelatin, i.e., horse hooves). Enjoy.\n\nIf I was a true vegetarian for animal rights, you’d say I was a vegan. And I know if you don’t understand vegetarianism, you really don’t understand veganism and what it takes to get there. Hint: You do it in stages. It just ends in an argument.\n\n...\n\nMy guess is that they think I’m an extreme left-wing, tree-hugging environmental activist who is trying to brainwash you to “my side.” Not that the profile is completely inaccurate, but for goodness sake, why would I waste my time trying to “brainwash” a person when I could be, I don’t know, shopping or watching TV, both of which are more productive.\n\nI’m not going to tell you why you shouldn’t eat meat, because you really don’t care. And I’m not going to tell you why I don’t, because\n\nyou really don’t care. If it’s something you’re truly interested in, you should say “Wow, tell me more about that!” If you want to argue, be content knowing that I won’t change my mind, and we can both save our breath."
