    "contenido": "American shoppers spent more than $42.8 billion on natural and organic products in 2003, according to research published in the 23rd Annual Market Overview in the June issue of The Natural Foods Merchandiser. The Natural Foods Merchandiser (_www.naturalfoodsmerchandiser.com_ (http://www.naturalfoodsmerchandiser.com/)) is the leading trade magazine serving the natural and organic products industry and is read by more than 15,000 retailers, industry leaders, and trend watchers each month.\n\nAs mainstream attention focused in 2003 on the many connections between diet and health, natural products sales increased 8.1% across all sales channels, including supermarkets, mass marketers, direct marketers, and the Internet. Sales of organic products rose 19% in natural products stores in 2003.\n\nConsumers expanded their organic and natural purchases beyond the kitchen in 2003. Some of the healthiest gains were in organic personal care, up 81%, and organic pet products, up 31%. Organic fresh meat and seafood posted 51% gains in sales. Nutrition bars, now a billion-dollar category in natural stores, rose 25%. Sales of specialty supplements, a category that includes such strong sellers as glucosamine and essential fatty acids, rose 13% in natural stores last year.\n\nIn 2003, consumers were deluged by news reports that questioned the safety of their food or the wisdom of conventional American eating habits. \"When stories hit about mad cow disease or trans fats, people look to natural and organic products for alternatives,\" said the publication's editor, Marty Traynor Spencer. \"We saw gains in every channel of trade, from small independent vitamin and health food stores to the largest supermarket chains.\"\n\nNatural products sales rose 7.8% to over $13.7 billion at supermarkets, discounters, drugstores, and other mass-market retailers."
