And your gun wouldn't leap from your possession to aim at those you meet on the street.\n\nAll the same, a gun is a very lethal thing, when not properly contained. That is why we don't often see folks leaving guns around their yard and dragging guns around the neighborhood.\n\nSwitch to a different scenario. An unleashed dog — one with large, powerful jaws that could tear through a human jugular without much problem. A dog that sees other smaller animals and children as little more than threatening chew toys. A dog whose owner has no visible control over it.\n\nUnfortunately, it isn't uncommon to see these intimidating canines pacing freely around their owners' yard or walking several yards in front of their owner while taking an afternoon walk together. It's something I have come across more than a few times in my life. Frankly, I don't know most of the dogs I encounter when I stroll around town. Sure, they may be the friendliest man-eaters around — wouldn't hurt a fly and all that gibberish."
