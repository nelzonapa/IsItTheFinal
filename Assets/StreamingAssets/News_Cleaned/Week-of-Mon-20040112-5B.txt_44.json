    "contenido": "When we lived in Japan, they had this delicacy called fugu - puffer fish. Only a licensed chef could make this dish, as a slip of the knife rendered it more toxic than cyanide. If it's prepared correctly, diners feel euphoric after eating fugu. If not, diners get dizzy, their mouths tingle, they can't breathe, and then they die.\n\nDangerous. But people still ate it. I didn't. But other people did.\n\n...\n\nOn Dec. 23, one American cow tested positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy - mad cow disease. The USDA recalled the entire day's meat production from that company. Eating meat from mad cows may cause humans to develop an illness that causes depression, psychosis, and immobility before death.\n\nScary. But people still ate it. I didn't. But other people\n\nWait a minute.\n\nLet's think about this.\n\n...\n\nBecause I'm not likely to give up my burger any time soon - even if it is poisonous. I'm likely to take up living on the edge. Likely to start making my own ground chuck. Likely to start up a dangerous little Hamburger Club on the edge of town - with hot jazz seeping into the alley. One where you'd have to recite the ingredients of a Big Mac to get in.\n\nWith my new, edgy, illegal, burger-driven lifestyle, I'm likely to be deported to a country where they don't even have the USDA. Just for spite, I'll set up an Americatown for expatriated burger-eating Americans. Patrons will sit at stools made of pickle tubs. Old Glory will swathe the walls. Little tubs of cholesterol will burn in dishes on the table. And the people of the world will come a-knocking at my door."
