    "contenido": "Proposed rules giving ranchers more flexibility to kill problem wolves still don't go far enough, angry ranchers and landowners told federal officials here Thursday night. Although new rules under consideration would allow ranchers to kill any wolf spotted near livestock, several people argued that wasn't enough. Several ranchers also claimed the federal government should start killing wolves due to their overpopulation and constant attacks on livestock. The landowners need to be able to kill a wolf whenever they see it, Paradise Valley rancher and outfitter Randy Petrich said. A standing-room-only crowd of more than 50 people packed the meeting at the city-county building, organized by Montana Sen. Conrad Burns. Ed Bangs, the wolf recovery leader for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, was joined by Clint Riley, special assistant to the director of the service. A Park County sheriff's deputy sat off to the side of the room, a testament to the cold atmosphere towards federal officials. Bangs was called a liar multiple times, and Lenny Gregorey, a former Livingston city commissioner, referred to him as \"Frankenstein\" and accused him of \"screwing\" all the ranchers in the room."
