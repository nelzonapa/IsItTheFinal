    "contenido": "Amanda Moeckel remembers standing in the Lunenburg High School cafeteria nine years ago campaigning for animal rights. Now, 24-year-old Moeckel is one of ten female finalists competing to be \"The Sexiest Vegetarian Alive.\" People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has gained national attention by highlighting the Lunenburg native, selecting her from hundreds of vegetarian contestants.\n\n\"It's kind of tongue-in-cheek humor to get people into vegetarianism... To get media in this country, sometimes you have to do crazy, insane stuff,\" Moeckel said from her home in San Francisco. \"I like to talk about vegetarianism as much as I can. It's a more compassionate lifestyle.\"\n\nMoeckel acknowledges that she does not fully agree with everything PETA has done for publicity, but she is grateful for their efforts. PETA is a national animal rights organization known for drawing national attention through various controversial protests against fur-wearing individuals. The group argues that vegetarians are healthier and more attractive than meat eaters.\n\nSince graduating from high school in Lunenburg, Moeckel has established her own art business, focusing mainly on creating animal portraits and advocating materials. Her artwork has been featured in publications such as \"The Animal's Agenda\" and \"The Abolitionist.\"\n\nMoeckel began avoiding meat in high school after reading \"Animal Liberation,\" which includes detailed accounts of animal testing and slaughter. She was initially an animal lover but did not question the treatment of animals until she read the book. Upon finishing it, she became aware of the harsh living conditions in factory farms. This realization led her to decide to stop supporting animal suffering herself."
