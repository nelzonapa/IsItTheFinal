    "contenido": "2004/2/27\n\nVeterinarians yesterday cast doubt over a recent speculation that a growing number of dogs died of renal failure because they all ate the same dog food made by a well-known international company.\n\nRumor is rife on the Internet that this particular brand of dog food contains too much salt and therefore causes terminal kidney diseases among dogs. Local media reported on the matter following a meeting at the Taoyuan County Veterinary Association earlier this week.\n\nChang Tsung-ming, secretary-general of the association, said members of his association have recently reported a rising number of renal failure cases but stressed that more research is needed before drawing any conclusion.\n\nThese dogs typically developed symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and difficulties in urination, according to Chang.\n\nHe has requested the 83 affiliated veterinarian hospitals to gather relevant diagnoses and data before the next member meeting, which has been moved ahead to early March.\n\nJosephine Chen, a spokeswoman for the dog food maker, refuted the allegation by saying that SGS testing showed a sodium chloride level of 0.34 percent in the dog food, which is far lower than the international standard of three percent.\n\n\"Our products are marketed in over 120 countries around the globe and we have never discovered similar incidents,\" she said, adding that the isolated cases in Taiwan should be subject to further testing."
