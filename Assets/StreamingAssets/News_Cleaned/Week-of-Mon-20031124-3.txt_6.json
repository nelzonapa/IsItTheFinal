    "contenido": "Fossil bones record the history of the human form, but they say little about behavior. A richer source of the way human social behavior evolved may be chimpanzees, with whom people shared a common ancestor as recently as 5 or 6 million years ago. From knowledge of chimp behavior, biologists can plausibly infer the social behavior of the shared human-chimp ancestor, and from that they can reconstruct the evolutionary history of human social behavior.\n\nSuch reconstructions are subject to much uncertainty and debate, especially when they imply a genetic basis of human behaviors like living in communities based on male kinship or conducting lethal campaigns against neighbors. But the goal is to shed light on the full sweep of human social behavior, tracing its evolution from an apelike community with separate male and female hierarchies 5 million years ago to the family-based societies of today.\n\nA principal assumption is that chimps, unlike people, have changed little and so their social behavior is a good guide to that of the common ancestor. One support for this idea is that the earliest fossils on the human side after the split are very chimplike. Another is that the chimps of western and eastern Africa are hard to tell apart, despite 1. 5 million years of separate evolution.\n\nAfter 40 years of arduous study, biologists have put together a coherent, though not yet complete, picture of chimpanzee societies. From observations at several sites in Africa, there is an \"emerging consensus regarding chimpanzee social structure, territory characteristics and intergroup interactions,\" two primatologists, Michael Wilson of the University of Minnesota and Richard Wrangham of Harvard, write in The Annual Review of Anthropology.\n\nChimps are not easy to observe. It can take five years for them to get used to watchers. They must be followed, through hilly country, for 15 hours at a stretch. They can be dangerous. Humphrey, a male chimp at the Gombe National Park in Tanzania, nearly killed Wrangham by hurling a large rock at his head. \"He was just showing off,\" Wrangham says indulgently. A female chimpanzee at Mahale, also in Tanzania, attacked and severely wounded two researchers she considered to be allies of males that had killed her infant.\n\nA major surprise has been that chimps turn out to live in territories whose borders are aggressively defended by roving parties of males. Jane Goodall, who pioneered long-term studies of chimps at Gombe, at first believed she was watching a single peaceful community. But as researchers started to follow animals throughout the day and watch their interaction with others, they found that groups of male chimps went out on border patrols, ready to attack and kill the males of neighboring communities.\n\nThe males in each community are related to one another because they spend their lives where they were born, whereas the females usually migrate to neighboring communities soon after reaching puberty, a practice that avoids inbreeding. This patrilocal system, of a community based on male kin bonding, is unusual, but familiar to anthropologists because it is practiced by most hunter-gatherer societies.\n\nThe males' operational strategy seems to be to defend a territory as large as possible so as to improve the community's food supply, which is principally fruit, and thereby their reproductive success. Anne Pusey of the University of Minnesota has found that the larger the territory, the more likely the community will survive."
