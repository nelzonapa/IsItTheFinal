    "contenido": "Many are aware of the controversial decision by the AKC to accept its High Volume Breeders Committee recommendation to once again include and recruit commercial breeders back into the AKC. As part of their study, the High Volume Breeder Committee, chaired by National Animal Interest Alliance founder Patti Strand, visited the Hunte Corp headquarters in Goodwin, MO and one of Petland's flagship stores. Hunte is the largest puppy mill broker in the US, while Petland has gained a reputation for having problems with commercially raised puppies for years.\n\nThanks to the efforts of Strand and the recommendations of the HVBC, pet consumers can now purchase AKC registrable puppies from any of the Petland stores located across the country. This marks the next step in the AKC's growing partnership with large-scale high-volume breeders—often referred to as simply puppy mills. The AKC is offering to allow any “breeder in good standing” to advertise on the AKC. Suddenly, the line between commercially bred irresponsibly breeding and the devoted dog fancier who breeds responsibly becomes more blurred and difficult to discern.\n\nI have often written that devoted, responsible breeders should not fear those seeking to end irresponsible breeding but must pay close attention to the AKC’s role in turning products of the puppy mills into “brand” names. How long will it be before the phrase “AKC registered” no longer means anything?"
