    "contenido": "DARIEN -- Priscilla Feral has had a busy winter. When she wasn't fighting with the state of Alaska over wolf hunting, she was brawling with Audubon Connecticut over deer hunting on its Greenwich sanctuary.\n\nDeserved or not, many animal rights groups have a reputation for extreme views, and those of Friends of Animals, based in Darien, may be the most radical. Feral, its president, is not afraid to attack not only hunters but environmental-protection agencies and animal cruelty prevention groups that do not go far enough.\n\nHer organization is not satisfied with improving conditions on factory farms, or advocating for less cruel hunting techniques. Friends of Animals wants to abolish these practices.\n\n\"If you get to the heart of the problem, that is probably radical,\" Feral said Friday at Friends of Animals headquarters on the Post Road. \"People ought to just stop eating animals.\"\n\nFeral was born Priscilla Brockway, but after her divorce in 1974, she took as her last name the word that describes a domestic animal gone wild.\n\n\"I gave serious consideration to it,\" she said. \"I did it with intent and to define myself.\"\n\nAnimals are sentient beings and there is no acceptable reason to harm them, according to Friends of Animals.\n\n\"We are animals, too,\" Feral said.\n\nBesides Darien, the group has offices in New York City and Washington, D.C., employs about two dozen workers and has an annual budget of $4 million to $5 million. Feral began volunteering with Friends of Animals in the 1970s and has been president since 1986."
