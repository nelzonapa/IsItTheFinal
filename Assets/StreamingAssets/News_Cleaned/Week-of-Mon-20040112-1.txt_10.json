    "contenido": "USDA Secretary Ann Veneman listed a national animal identification program as a major USDA policy priority for mad cow disease prevention. USDA has worked with federal and state governments, and with the food-animal industry for the past 18 months toward the adoption of a verifiable nationwide animal identification system, says Veneman. The point is to help enhance the speed and accuracy of the United States' response to disease outbreaks across many different animal species. \"I have asked USDA's Chief Information Officer to expedite the development of the technology architecture to implement this (identification) system as a top priority,\" she adds.\n\nImplementation of USAIP is scheduled to occur in three phases:\n\n* Phase I: Involves premises identification, and is set to begin by July. This phase would require establishing standardized premises identification numbers for all U.S. production operations, markets, assembly points, exhibitions, and processing plants.\n* Phase II: Would enable individual animal or group/lot identification for interstate and intrastate commerce.\n* Phase III: Involves retrofitting remaining processing plants and markets and other industry segments with appropriate technology to enhance traceability of animals throughout the livestock marketing system.\n\nIf the Bush Administration gives priority to the USAIP, bureaucratic obstacles will be fewer, Slack predicts. \"The other big question is money. Who's going to pay for it? Secretary Veneman says this is needed to protect public health. It's logical that tax dollars be spent to set up a world-class system,\" he contends."
