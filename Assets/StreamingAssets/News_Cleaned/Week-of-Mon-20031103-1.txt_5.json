    "contenido": "On most evenings this fall, when Bonnie McElrath and her 8-year-old daughter, Kylie, fed their horses boarded in a Coker Butte pasture, they were visited by 50 of the biggest and most majestic creatures Oregon's woods have to offer.\n\nMcElrath's horses shared the pasture with a herd of Roosevelt elk that has graced rural ranches and pear orchards along Medford city limits for the past 20 years.\n\nProtected and coddled by landowners between Highway 62 and Foothill Road, the normally wary elk paid little mind to the McElraths as they sat spellbound, soaking in the elk's grunts and smells, something most Oregonians never experience.\n\n\"We'd sit there and it was just incredible how the elk would mill around us, and there's no way I'd do anything to bother them,\" McElrath says. \"There's an unwritten rule among everyone here that you leave that herd alone.\"\n\nBut there are no written rules that the herd is off-limits to sport hunting. And when two of the elk, including a large six-point bull that was their leader, were shot legally by two hunters during the recent elk season, the incident incensed people such as McElrath who view those elk more like neighbors than wild animals.\n\n\"That herd, basically, belongs to everyone in this valley,\" McElrath says. \"I think it's disgusting. I can't even tell my daughter what happened. It would devastate her.\"\n\nAs cities continue to creep toward Oregon's wildlands, big-game hunting within the shadows of urban areas is becoming a hot issue along both ends of Interstate 5.\n\nShooting guns within city limits is illegal in Oregon, but cases like Medford's elk and a similar incident involving a black-tailed deer near Portland have created a call for extending the no-hunting zones out to cities' urban growth boundaries."
