    "contenido": "I really like your column! I'm just a little kitten, but I hope that someday I'm as smart as you are, and maybe I can help other kitties and their people too. But I wonder... well, maybe it's just because I'm still a baby, but sometimes I get confused about who's who. You talk about your dog and your grandma and grandpa-kitties and your mom and stuff, and I'd just like to get some idea of who's what, if you know what I mean. Were you ever kittens? Are you fixed? How did you get so smart? Maybe you can put up some pictures of yourselves so we can see who's writing the column. I bet you're really cute! *buries nose under tail shyly*\n\nSincerely,\n\nSin?ad: Buster, thank you so much for your compliments. We love to hear from kittens, and we're quite happy to answer your questions and show you some pictures. We'll ask Mama to include some photos when she puts our column up online.\n\nSiouxsie: We were indeed kittens once. Tiny little kittens that fit in the palm of our Mama's hand. Mama took lots of pictures of us when we were babies, but unfortunately, she only scanned one. Still, it will give you an idea of what we looked like when we were babies.\n\nSin?ad: How did we get so smart? Darling, we asked lots of questions and learned about everything we could. Mama always reads books about cats and dogs and all kinds of things, so we learn a lot from her. After all, we cats are telepathic and can read our person's mind."
