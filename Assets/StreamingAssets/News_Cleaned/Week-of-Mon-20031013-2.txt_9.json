    "contenido": "The redhead walking by told him that there were others like him. It was okay, she said, as she left the kitchen after rinsing her dish. She ate fish. Still, Matt Bornstein-Grove, 20, was the only person at the Tacoma Veggies potluck last month who didn't eat poultry or red meat. He came along with other University of Puget Sound students because he was considering becoming vegan, and now he was surrounded by nearly 25 people, mostly vegans who regarded animal and animal-tested products as murderous or abusive.\n\nIt wasn't that he disagreed with their convictions. \"It's just laziness on my part,\" he said. \"I feel like if I'm going to do it, I have to become committed on all fronts—become more aware of how things are made, buy from responsible companies.\" It's a tall order. Veganism, the strictest vegetarian lifestyle, eschews not only meat, fish, and dairy but also gelatin, cashmere, glycerin, honey, keratin, and wax. Veganism means no leather boots, no gummy bears, no Tylenol Gelcaps.\n\nVegans at this potluck dinner drew the line at microbes, which meant they weren't opposed to drinking beer. But the drinks for this mostly underaged crew were Silk soymilk and Silk chocolate soymilk. The atmosphere inside the house near Sixth Avenue was one of granola, bare feet outnumbering lipsticked lips."
