    "contenido": "A man who was once on the FBI's most wanted list revealed Wednesday that he is claiming refugee status in Canada. Michael Scarpitti, who goes by the name Tre Arrow, appeared before an Immigration and Refugee Board adjudicator to make the claim. An acquaintance, David Barbarash, a political activist who has been charged in the past, said Scarpitti was being treated unfairly by authorities in the U.S. The Crown filed a notice of abandonment in B.C. Supreme Court concerning Barbarash, a former Animal Liberation Front spokesperson."
