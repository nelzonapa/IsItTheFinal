The type of person who is going to go for a low-fat, vegetarian diet is not, in my experience, the kind of person who is going to go for a high-meat diet, according to Dansinger. But for people with high cholesterol levels, the Ornish diet might be the most beneficial, Dansinger said. The Ornish diet, which is low-fat vegetarian, was best for lowering the bad LDL cholesterol, while other diets were better at raising the good HDL cholesterol. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is the stuff that clogs arteries, while high-density lipoprotein carries fat out of the blood. The Ornish diet cut LDL by 10 percent and Atkins lowered it 2 percent to 3 percent, Dansinger said. Ornish said doctors often place too high a value on high HDL levels. If you reduce fat, there is less garbage, less saturated fat and cholesterol, so your body needs less garbage trucks, he said. But Dansinger said his study was one of several that have suggested the high-fat Atkins diet, in the short-term, does not raise the risk of heart disease."
