    "contenido": "WASHINGTON: The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported Wednesday that a cow initially tested positive for mad cow disease had come back negative on follow-up testing. However, a food industry consultant estimated that there could be over 100 cases of the deadly disorder in the country's herds.\n\nAbout half of these cases would go undetected and pass on to humans through consumption. Robert LaBudde, president of Least Cost Formulation Ltd., a food industry consultancy in Virginia Beach, Va., told UPI that this estimate was based on his experience working at universities such as the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThe USDA is still awaiting results from another case that initially tested positive on Tuesday. These results may take four to seven days. Under the agency's expanded surveillance plan, which came into effect on June 1, cows initially undergo screening using rapid tests before being followed up with confirmatory testing. To date, the only confirmed case of mad cow disease in the United States occurred in Washington state last December.\n\nLaBudde believes that multiple cases of BSE-positive cattle will be identified. He stated, \"There is no question that we will see between a dozen and potentially hundreds of cases of BSE-positive cattle in our national herd.\" His clients include the meat industry."
